## Git Workflow

**For all changes:**
1. Create a feature branch from main: `git checkout -b feature/description`
2. Make commits on the feature branch
3. Push to origin: `git push origin feature/description`
4. Open PR for review

**Never commit directly to main.** All work happens on feature branches.
