# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-28 — Release Automation

Kata v1.3.0 integrates release workflow into milestone completion: version detection, changelog generation, and GitHub Release creation.

### Added
- **Release workflow in milestone completion**: `/kata:completing-milestones` now offers release workflow before verification
- **Version detection reference**: `version-detector.md` with semantic version detection from conventional commits
- **Changelog generation reference**: `changelog-generator.md` with Keep a Changelog format and commit-to-section mapping
- **Dry-run mode**: Preview version bump and changelog without applying changes
- **PR workflow integration**: Instructions for PR merge vs direct `gh release create` based on config

### Changed
- **Milestone completion skill**: Updated description with release triggers (release version, create release, ship milestone)
- **Execution phase workflow**: Consolidated post-execution options into step 10.6 checkpoint loop
- **README**: Updated for v1.3.0 with What's New section documenting release automation

### Fixed
- **Merge timing**: Merge now offered after UAT/PR review, not before

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **GitHub issue body updates**: Replaced awk with Python script for reliable multiline content handling in plan checklists
- **Skill scripts directory**: Plugin build now includes `skills/*/scripts/` directories (was globally excluded)
- **Script path resolution**: Skills use base directory from invocation header instead of hardcoded marketplace paths

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **VERSION file path**: Skills now correctly reference `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/VERSION` instead of deprecated `kata/VERSION` path
- **Removed deprecated NPX fallbacks**: Skills no longer check `~/.claude/kata/VERSION` paths (NPX deprecated in v1.1.0)

### Removed
- **Stale `kata/VERSION` file**: Removed outdated source file (build generates VERSION correctly)

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-27 — Release Process Automation

Kata v1.2.0 automates the release pipeline: CI now creates GitHub Releases with tags automatically.

### Added
- **Automated GitHub Releases**: CI workflow creates GitHub Releases with tags on version change
- **Changelog extraction**: Release notes automatically extracted from CHANGELOG.md

### Changed
- **Release skill updated**: `releasing-kata` reflects plugin-only distribution (NPM deprecated)
- **CI permissions**: `plugin-release.yml` now has `contents: write` for release creation

### Removed
- **NPM references**: Removed all NPM publishing references from release documentation
- **Outdated troubleshooting**: Removed NPM-specific troubleshooting sections
- **Deprecated NPX smoke tests**: Removed NPX install tests from smoke.test.js (NPX deprecated in v1.1.0)

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-27 — GitHub Integration

Kata v1.1.0 ships **GitHub Integration**: config-driven GitHub Milestone, Issue, and PR workflows.

### Added
- **GitHub config namespace**: `.planning/config.json` now includes `github.enabled` and `github.issueMode` settings
- **GitHub Milestone creation**: `/kata:adding-milestones` creates GitHub Milestones via `gh api`
- **Phase issue creation**: Phases become GitHub Issues with `phase` label, assigned to milestone
- **Plan checklist sync**: Plans shown as checklist items in phase issues, checked as plans complete
- **PR integration**: `/kata:executing-phases` creates branches, draft PRs with "Closes #X" linking, marks ready on completion
- **PR status display**: `/kata:tracking-progress` shows PR status (Draft/Ready/Merged)
- **PR review workflow**: `/kata:review-pr` command with 6 specialized review agents
- **Test harness**: 27 skill tests with affected-test detection and CI/CD integration

### Changed
- **Plugin-only distribution**: NPX support deprecated; install via Claude Code plugin marketplace
- **Skill directory naming**: Renamed from `kata-*` to `*` (27 skills)
- **Build system simplified**: NPM target removed, plugin build retained

### Removed
- **NPX distribution path**: `bin/install.js` now shows deprecation message
- **Update skill**: Removed `kata-updating` (plugin updates via marketplace)
- **NPX hooks**: Removed `kata-check-update.js`, `kata-npm-statusline.js`

---

## [1.1.15] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **NPX install failure**: Fixed `ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir '.../kata/kata'` error when running `npx @gannonh/kata`. The `kata/` source directory was removed in v1.0.6 but three places still referenced it:
  - `package.json` files field listed `"kata"` (build.js now filters it out)
  - `bin/install.js` tried to copy from non-existent `kata/` directory (removed)
  - `bin/install.js` CHANGELOG copy failed because kata dest dir wasn't created first (fixed ordering)

## [1.1.14] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Plugin Skill() invocation**: Build system now transforms `Skill("kata-xxx")` to `Skill("kata:xxx")` for plugin distribution. Commands calling skills failed with "Unknown skill" because skill directories are renamed (`kata-xxx` → `xxx`) but Skill() calls weren't being transformed to match the plugin namespace.

## [1.1.10] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Restored v1.0.8 working state**: Reverted commands, skills, agents, and build.js to v1.0.8 state. Commands use `phase-add` style naming, skills use `adding-phases` style - no namespace conflicts.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Plugin skill invocation**: Removed commands from plugin build. Commands and skills had same namespace (`kata:adding-phases`) causing conflicts. Skills now handle everything in plugin context with `user-invocable: true`.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Reverted skills-only architecture**: Rolled back to v1.0.8 codebase. The v1.1.x skills-only changes broke natural language invocation entirely — skills with `user-invocable: false` were hidden from the Skill tool, and commands with `disable-model-invocation: true` were blocked.

### Architecture
- Commands + Skills architecture restored (commands for autocomplete, skills for implementation)
- Skills: `user-invocable: false`, `disable-model-invocation: false`
- Commands delegate to skills via Task tool

## [1.1.0 - 1.1.7] - 2026-01-25 (REVERTED)

**These releases attempted a skills-only architecture that broke natural language invocation. Reverted in 1.1.8.**

## [1.0.8] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Stale template references**: Fixed 15+ prose references to `$KATA_BASE/templates/` in skills and agents that remained after Phase 2.1 skill-centric restructure
- **Nested reference paths**: Fixed `@./references/` paths inside `references/` directories to use sibling-relative `@./` syntax
- **Test suite alignment**: Updated tests to reflect Phase 2.1 architecture (skills use local `@./references/` paths, no shared `kata/` directory)
- **resolveRef() relative path handling**: Fixed path resolution to correctly handle `@./` references relative to the containing file's directory

### Added
- **Local plugin testing script**: Added `scripts/test-local.sh` for easy local plugin testing during development

## [1.0.7] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin agent namespacing**: Build system now transforms `subagent_type="kata-*"` to `subagent_type="kata:kata-*"` for plugin distribution. Claude Code namespaces plugin agents as `pluginname:agentname`, so skills referencing agents like `kata-executor` need the `kata:` prefix in plugin context. Source files remain unchanged for npx distribution compatibility.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin path transformation**: Fixed `build.js` to transform `@~/.claude/kata/` → `@./kata/` (was incorrectly producing `@./`). This caused "file not found" errors when plugin skills referenced templates, workflows, and references.

### Added
- **Path transformation tests**: New tests verify plugin `@-references` use the correct `@./kata/` pattern and resolve to existing files
- **Release skill**: Added `.claude/skills/releasing-kata/` for guided release workflow

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin marketplace deployment**: Fixed workflow to include hidden directories (`.claude-plugin/`) when copying to marketplace — bash glob `*` doesn't match hidden dirs

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin path resolution (v2)**: Reverted `@$KATA_BASE/` approach from 1.0.3 — Claude's `@` reference system is a static file path parser that cannot substitute variables. Restored canonical `@~/.claude/kata/` paths which `build.js` transforms correctly to `@./kata/` for plugins.

### Changed
- **Removed `<kata_path>` blocks**: These blocks didn't help with @ references since Claude can't use bash-resolved variables in @ paths

### Added
- **Tests to catch this class of bug**: New tests detect `@$VARIABLE/` and `@${VAR}/` patterns in source files (which will never work)
- **Integration test for plugin @ references**: Verifies that plugin build @ references resolve to existing files
- **Path reference documentation**: Added section to KATA-STYLE.md explaining why @ references must use static paths

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Plugin path resolution**: Attempted to fix "Error reading file" when agents load templates by adding `$KATA_BASE` path resolution (reverted in 1.0.4 — this approach doesn't work)

### Added
- **Test coverage for path resolution**: Added tests for path resolution (updated in 1.0.4)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Marketplace version update**: Fixed plugin-release workflow to update version in correct path (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Plugin release workflow**: Changed trigger from `release` event to `workflow_run` to fix GitHub limitation where workflows using GITHUB_TOKEN don't trigger downstream workflows
- **CI test runner**: Fixed glob pattern expansion issue on CI runners
- **NPM publish**: Removed dev scripts from dist package.json to prevent prepublishOnly failures

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-23

Kata 1.0 ships with **Claude Code plugin support** as the recommended installation method.

### Added
- **Claude Code plugin distribution**: Install via `/plugin marketplace add gannonh/kata-marketplace` + `/plugin install kata@gannonh-kata-marketplace`
- **Dual build system**: `node scripts/build.js` produces both NPM and plugin distributions
- **Plugin-aware statusline**: Detects installation method (NPM vs plugin) and shows appropriate update commands
- **CI validation pipelines**: Tests and build artifact validation run before NPM publish and plugin release
- **Plugin marketplace badge**: README now shows both plugin and NPM badges

### Changed
- **Plugin install is now recommended**: Getting Started section leads with marketplace install, NPM moved to collapsible alternative
- **Command namespace**: All commands now use `kata:` prefix (e.g., `/kata:providing-help`, `/kata:planning-phases`)
- **Hook scripts converted to ES modules**: All hooks now use ESM syntax
- **Staying Updated section**: Split into separate commands for plugin and NPM users

### Fixed
- Source directory detection in update skill prevents npx failure
- Stale `kata-cc` references updated to `@gannonh/kata`
- Main branch push blocking logic updated to new format
- Removed unused hooks and statusline from default settings

## [0.1.8] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- Phonetic pronunciation (/ˈkɑːtɑː/) below kanji in all SVG assets

### Changed
- **Brand refresh**: Updated visual identity to match new website design
  - New color palette: Amber (#d4a574) replaces Kata Blue (#7aa2f7)
  - Background: Ink (#0d0d0d) replaces Deep Slate (#0f0f14)
  - Typography: Noto Serif JP (weight 200) for kanji mark
- **CLI installer**: Simplified to standard ANSI colors for terminal compatibility
- **All SVG assets**: Updated with new brand colors

- **GitHub Actions scaffolding**: Scaffold release workflow during project-new when pr_workflow enabled
- **Config schema documentation**: Full schema reference in `kata/references/planning-config.md`
- **Missing config key detection**: Settings skill detects and prompts for missing config keys

### Changed
- Config schema now includes `commit_docs` and `pr_workflow` options
- Settings skill presents 6 settings (was 5)
- PR workflow defaults to "No" (direct commits to main)

### Fixed
- Hooks installation now handles subdirectories correctly
- GSD reference validation in transform workflow

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Skills architecture**: 14 specialized skills as orchestrators that spawn sub-agents via Task tool
- **Slash command suite**: 25 commands delegating to skills with `disable-model-invocation: true`
- **Test harness**: CLI-based testing framework using `claude "prompt"` for skill verification
- **kata-managing-todos skill**: ADD/CHECK operations with duplicate detection
- **kata-discussing-phases skill**: Pre-planning context gathering with adaptive questioning
- **Quick task skill**: Fast execution for small ad-hoc tasks with Kata guarantees

### Changed
- Skills use gerund (verb-ing) naming convention with exhaustive trigger phrases
- Skills have `user-invocable: false` to control invocation via commands or natural language
- ESM module type added to package.json for test harness compatibility

### Fixed
- Skill trigger reliability via exhaustive description trigger phrases
- Research workflow clarified with tripartite split (discuss, research, assumptions)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- Global install now properly adds Kata SessionStart hook when other SessionStart hooks are already configured

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-18
