# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.14] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Plugin Skill() invocation**: Build system now transforms `Skill("kata-xxx")` to `Skill("kata:xxx")` for plugin distribution. Commands calling skills failed with "Unknown skill" because skill directories are renamed (`kata-xxx` → `xxx`) but Skill() calls weren't being transformed to match the plugin namespace.

## [1.1.10] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Restored v1.0.8 working state**: Reverted commands, skills, agents, and build.js to v1.0.8 state. Commands use `phase-add` style naming, skills use `adding-phases` style - no namespace conflicts.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Plugin skill invocation**: Removed commands from plugin build. Commands and skills had same namespace (`kata:adding-phases`) causing conflicts. Skills now handle everything in plugin context with `user-invocable: true`.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Reverted skills-only architecture**: Rolled back to v1.0.8 codebase. The v1.1.x skills-only changes broke natural language invocation entirely — skills with `user-invocable: false` were hidden from the Skill tool, and commands with `disable-model-invocation: true` were blocked.

### Architecture
- Commands + Skills architecture restored (commands for autocomplete, skills for implementation)
- Skills: `user-invocable: false`, `disable-model-invocation: false`
- Commands delegate to skills via Task tool

## [1.1.0 - 1.1.7] - 2026-01-25 (REVERTED)

**These releases attempted a skills-only architecture that broke natural language invocation. Reverted in 1.1.8.**

## [1.0.8] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Stale template references**: Fixed 15+ prose references to `$KATA_BASE/templates/` in skills and agents that remained after Phase 2.1 skill-centric restructure
- **Nested reference paths**: Fixed `@./references/` paths inside `references/` directories to use sibling-relative `@./` syntax
- **Test suite alignment**: Updated tests to reflect Phase 2.1 architecture (skills use local `@./references/` paths, no shared `kata/` directory)
- **resolveRef() relative path handling**: Fixed path resolution to correctly handle `@./` references relative to the containing file's directory

### Added
- **Local plugin testing script**: Added `scripts/test-local.sh` for easy local plugin testing during development

## [1.0.7] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin agent namespacing**: Build system now transforms `subagent_type="kata-*"` to `subagent_type="kata:kata-*"` for plugin distribution. Claude Code namespaces plugin agents as `pluginname:agentname`, so skills referencing agents like `kata-executor` need the `kata:` prefix in plugin context. Source files remain unchanged for npx distribution compatibility.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin path transformation**: Fixed `build.js` to transform `@~/.claude/kata/` → `@./kata/` (was incorrectly producing `@./`). This caused "file not found" errors when plugin skills referenced templates, workflows, and references.

### Added
- **Path transformation tests**: New tests verify plugin `@-references` use the correct `@./kata/` pattern and resolve to existing files
- **Release skill**: Added `.claude/skills/releasing-kata/` for guided release workflow

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin marketplace deployment**: Fixed workflow to include hidden directories (`.claude-plugin/`) when copying to marketplace — bash glob `*` doesn't match hidden dirs

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin path resolution (v2)**: Reverted `@$KATA_BASE/` approach from 1.0.3 — Claude's `@` reference system is a static file path parser that cannot substitute variables. Restored canonical `@~/.claude/kata/` paths which `build.js` transforms correctly to `@./kata/` for plugins.

### Changed
- **Removed `<kata_path>` blocks**: These blocks didn't help with @ references since Claude can't use bash-resolved variables in @ paths

### Added
- **Tests to catch this class of bug**: New tests detect `@$VARIABLE/` and `@${VAR}/` patterns in source files (which will never work)
- **Integration test for plugin @ references**: Verifies that plugin build @ references resolve to existing files
- **Path reference documentation**: Added section to KATA-STYLE.md explaining why @ references must use static paths

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Plugin path resolution**: Attempted to fix "Error reading file" when agents load templates by adding `$KATA_BASE` path resolution (reverted in 1.0.4 — this approach doesn't work)

### Added
- **Test coverage for path resolution**: Added tests for path resolution (updated in 1.0.4)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Marketplace version update**: Fixed plugin-release workflow to update version in correct path (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Plugin release workflow**: Changed trigger from `release` event to `workflow_run` to fix GitHub limitation where workflows using GITHUB_TOKEN don't trigger downstream workflows
- **CI test runner**: Fixed glob pattern expansion issue on CI runners
- **NPM publish**: Removed dev scripts from dist package.json to prevent prepublishOnly failures

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-23

Kata 1.0 ships with **Claude Code plugin support** as the recommended installation method.

### Added
- **Claude Code plugin distribution**: Install via `/plugin marketplace add gannonh/kata-marketplace` + `/plugin install kata@gannonh-kata-marketplace`
- **Dual build system**: `node scripts/build.js` produces both NPM and plugin distributions
- **Plugin-aware statusline**: Detects installation method (NPM vs plugin) and shows appropriate update commands
- **CI validation pipelines**: Tests and build artifact validation run before NPM publish and plugin release
- **Plugin marketplace badge**: README now shows both plugin and NPM badges

### Changed
- **Plugin install is now recommended**: Getting Started section leads with marketplace install, NPM moved to collapsible alternative
- **Command namespace**: All commands now use `kata:` prefix (e.g., `/kata:providing-help`, `/kata:planning-phases`)
- **Hook scripts converted to ES modules**: All hooks now use ESM syntax
- **Staying Updated section**: Split into separate commands for plugin and NPM users

### Fixed
- Source directory detection in update skill prevents npx failure
- Stale `kata-cc` references updated to `@gannonh/kata`
- Main branch push blocking logic updated to new format

- Settings skill presents 6 settings (was 5)
- PR workflow defaults to "No" (direct commits to main)

### Fixed
- Hooks installation now handles subdirectories correctly
- GSD reference validation in transform workflow

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Skills architecture**: 14 specialized skills as orchestrators that spawn sub-agents via Task tool
- **Slash command suite**: 25 commands delegating to skills with `disable-model-invocation: true`
