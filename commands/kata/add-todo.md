<objective>

Enables "thought → capture → continue" flow without losing context or derailing current work.
</objective>

<step name="extract_content">
**With arguments:** Use as the title/focus.
- `/gsd:add-todo Add auth token refresh` → title = "Add auth token refresh"

**Without arguments:** Analyze recent conversation to extract:
- The specific problem, idea, or task discussed
- Relevant file paths mentioned
- Technical details (error messages, line numbers, constraints)

Formulate:
- `title`: 3-10 word descriptive title (action verb preferred)
- `problem`: What's wrong or why this is needed
- `solution`: Approach hints or "TBD" if just an idea
- `files`: Relevant paths with line numbers from conversation
