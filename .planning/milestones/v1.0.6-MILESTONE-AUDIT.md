# Milestone v1.0.6: Plugin Stability — Audit Report

**Milestone Goal:** Plugin stability through skill-centric resource restructuring
**Audited:** 2026-01-24T22:15:00Z
**Status:** PASSED

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.0.6 (Plugin Stability) is complete. The single phase (2.1 Skill-Centric Resource Restructure) successfully transformed Kata's architecture from shared kata/ directories to self-contained skills with bundled resources.

**Key achievements:**
- 10 skills now have local references/ directories with 28 resource files
- 4 agent resource files bundled in agents/references/
- Build system simplified (kata/ removed from COMMON_INCLUDES)
- Both plugin and npm distributions produce clean, self-contained output
- Zero external @~/.claude/kata/ references remain

## Scores

| Category | Score | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | N/A | Urgent insertion phase — no mapped requirements |
| Phases | 1/1 | Phase 2.1 complete (5/5 plans) |
| Integration | 10/10 | All key links verified |
| E2E Flows | 3/3 | Skill invocation, nested resources, build→distribution |

## Phase Verification Summary

### Phase 2.1: Skill-Centric Resource Restructure

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Skills have local references/ | ✓ VERIFIED | 10 skills, 28 files |
| No shared kata/ directories | ✓ VERIFIED | templates/, workflows/, references/ removed |
| No @~/.claude/kata/ references | ✓ VERIFIED | 0 matches in skills/agents/commands |
| Build system updated | ✓ VERIFIED | kata removed from COMMON_INCLUDES |
| Commands continue to function | ✓ VERIFIED | Skill() delegation works |

**Plan execution:**
- Plan 01: Copy resources → 2 tasks, 21 files created
- Plan 02: Update skill references → 3 tasks, 20 files modified
- Plan 03: Agent references → 3 tasks, 5 files
- Plan 04: Build system cleanup → 2 tasks, 3 files
- Plan 05: Remove shared directories → 3 tasks, 53 files deleted

**Deviations handled:**
- Plan 02: Added 7 missing nested resource files (auto-fixed)
- Plan 04: Fixed 2 agent resource issues (auto-fixed)

## Integration Verification

### Cross-Phase Chain

| Plan | Requires | Provides | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| 02.1-01 | (none) | 10 skill references/ dirs | CONNECTED |
| 02.1-02 | 02.1-01 | Skills using @./references/ | CONNECTED |
| 02.1-03 | (independent) | Agents using @./references/ | CONNECTED |
| 02.1-04 | 02.1-02, 02.1-03 | Updated build.js | CONNECTED |
| 02.1-05 | 02.1-04 | Removed shared kata/ | TERMINAL |

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Skill invocation | Command → Skill → @./references/ → Load | COMPLETE |
| Nested resources | phase-execute.md → @./execute-plan.md | COMPLETE |
| Build distribution | build.js → dist/ → bundled references | COMPLETE |

### Distribution Cleanliness

**Plugin (dist/plugin/):**
- Skills bundled: 10/10 with references/
- Stale references: 0
- Contains: commands/, skills/, agents/, hooks/, VERSION

**NPM (dist/npm/):**
- Skills bundled: 10/10 with references/
- Stale references: 0
- Contains: commands/, skills/, agents/, hooks/, bin/, package.json

## Tech Debt

Minor items that don't block release:

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 2.1 | kata-planning-phases/SKILL.md at 521 lines | Info |
| 2.1 | kata-starting-milestones/SKILL.md at 723 lines | Info |
| 2.1 | kata-starting-projects/SKILL.md at 1206 lines | Warning |

**Recommendation:** Future work could move more content from SKILL.md files to references/ subdirectories to comply with the Agent Skills 500-line recommendation. This is optimization, not a blocker.

## Gaps

**No gaps found.**

All success criteria met:
1. ✓ Skills self-contained with bundled resources
2. ✓ No shared kata/ cross-cutting resources
3. ✓ Zero external @~/.claude/kata/ references
4. ✓ Build system handles new structure
5. ✓ Commands continue functioning

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.0.6 achieved its goal of plugin stability through skill self-containment. The restructure enables:

- **npx-style distribution:** Skills can be distributed independently (Vercel model)
- **Standards compliance:** Agent Skills spec recommends self-contained skills
- **Simplified build:** No path transformation needed for kata/ references
- **Cleaner distributions:** Both plugin and npm outputs are self-contained

**Verdict:** Ready for milestone completion.
