## Note on Requirements

v1.0.8 was an urgent insertion milestone (Phase 2.1) created to stabilize plugin distribution after rapid patch releases v1.0.1-v1.0.5. It did not have formal requirements — the goal was architectural restructuring for stability.

The REQUIREMENTS.md file at time of this milestone was for the original v0.1.9 (which became v1.0.0) plugin work. Those requirements were fulfilled by v1.0.0.

## Phase 2.1 Success Criteria (Fulfilled)

These were defined in ROADMAP.md phase details:

- [x] Skills self-contained with bundled resources
- [x] No shared kata/ cross-cutting resources
- [x] Zero external @~/.claude/kata/ references
