# Milestone v1.3.3: Internal Documentation

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-29
**Phases:** 1
**Total Plans:** 4 (2 main + 2 gap closure)

## Overview

Kata v1.3.3 ships internal documentation: workflow diagrams documenting major paths through the system, and a comprehensive terminology glossary for onboarding contributors and future Claude instances.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Internal Documentation

**Goal**: Create Mermaid flow diagrams and terminology glossary
**Depends on**: v1.3.0 complete
**Plans**: 4 plans (2 main + 2 gap closure)

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Create 6 Mermaid workflow diagrams (TOOL-01)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Create terminology glossary with relationships (TOOL-02)
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Gap closure: Simplify orchestration diagram
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Gap closure: Add dark theme to diagrams

**Details:**

**Success Criteria** (all achieved):
1. ✅ Mermaid diagrams exist for major workflow paths (orchestration, lifecycle, planning, execution, verification, PR)
2. ✅ Diagrams stored in `.docs/` for progressive disclosure
3. ✅ Kata glossary defines all key terms (milestone, phase, issue, plan, etc.)
4. ✅ Glossary shows relationships between concepts
5. ✅ Documentation is usable by both humans and future Claude instances

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Store diagrams in `.docs/diagrams/` for progressive disclosure (not loaded by default)
- Use Mermaid flowcharts (renders in GitHub, VS Code, mermaid.live)
- Organize glossary by category (project structure, artifacts, agents, skills, workflows)
- Apply dark theme styling consistently across all diagrams

**Issues Resolved:**
- UAT Issue #1: Orchestration diagram too complex → simplified with clearer grouping
- UAT Issue #2: Diagrams lack dark theme → added consistent Anthropic-inspired colors

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
