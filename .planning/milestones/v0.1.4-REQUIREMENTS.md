# Requirements Archive: v0.1.4 Hard Fork & Rebrand

**Archived:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** SHIPPED

This is the archived requirements specification for v0.1.4.
For current requirements, see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (created for next milestone).

---

## Note on Phase 0

Phase 0 (Hard Fork & Rebrand) was inserted before the formal requirements were defined. It has no mapped requirements in the requirements document because:

1. The requirements document was created as part of v1.0 planning
2. Phase 0 addressed a prerequisite concern (establishing independent identity)
3. Success criteria were defined in ROADMAP.md, not REQUIREMENTS.md

**Phase 0 Success Criteria (all met):**
1. All references to original project (glittercowboy) removed or updated
2. Project branding applied consistently (Kata by gannonh)
3. Git history preserved but upstream remote removed
4. CLAUDE.md updated to reflect standalone project (no upstream sync)
5. Package author and repository updated to gannonh
