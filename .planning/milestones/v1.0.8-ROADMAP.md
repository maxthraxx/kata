# Milestone v1.0.8: Plugin Stability

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-24
**Phases:** 2.1 (inserted)
**Total Plans:** 5
**Patches:** v1.0.6, v1.0.7, v1.0.8

## Overview

Plugin stability through skill-centric resource restructuring. After v1.0.0-v1.0.5 patch releases addressing plugin distribution issues, this milestone transformed Kata's architecture from shared `kata/` directories to self-contained skills with bundled resources.

## Phases

### Phase 2.1: Skill-Centric Resource Restructure (INSERTED)

**Goal:** Make skills self-contained with bundled resources for npx-style distribution (Vercel model)
**Depends on:** v1.0.5 (plugin path fixes)
**Plans:** 5 plans

Plans:

- [x] 02.1-01: Copy resources to skill directories (21 files → 10 skills)
- [x] 02.1-02: Update skill @-references to use local paths
- [x] 02.1-03: Update agent @-references to use local paths
- [x] 02.1-04: Clean up build system (remove kata/ from COMMON_INCLUDES)
- [x] 02.1-05: Remove shared kata/ directories (53 files deleted)

**Deviations handled:**
- Plan 02: Added 7 missing nested resource files (auto-fixed)
- Plan 04: Fixed 2 agent resource issues (auto-fixed)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 2.1: Skill-Centric Resource Restructure (inserted after v1.0.0-v1.0.5 patches for stability)

**Key Decisions:**
- Templates renamed with `-template` suffix to distinguish from workflow references
- Duplication accepted as cost of skill independence per Agent Skills spec
- Skills bundle their own resources (no external kata/ dependencies)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Plugin path resolution errors (`@~/.claude/kata/` → `@./kata/`)
- Agent namespacing in plugin distribution (`kata-*` → `kata:kata-*`)
- Shared directory coupling preventing independent skill distribution

**Issues Deferred:**
- Large SKILL.md files (kata-starting-projects at 1206 lines) — optimization, not blocker

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- 3 skills exceed 500-line recommendation (521, 723, 1206 lines) — future refactoring to references/
