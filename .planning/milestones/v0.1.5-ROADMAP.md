# Milestone v0.1.5: Skills & Documentation

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-22
**Phases:** 0, 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2 (6 phases)
**Total Plans:** 30

## Overview

Skills architecture milestone establishing Kata's core skill system. Created 14 specialized skills as orchestrators that spawn sub-agents, plus 25 slash commands for explicit invocation.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Convert Commands to Skills

**Goal**: Create 8 skills as orchestrators following /building-claude-code-skills methodology
**Strategy** (REVISED 2026-01-19):
- Skills only — Create skills containing full workflow logic
- Leave commands unchanged — Keep for A/B testing between old commands and new skills
- No agent-skill binding — Skills ARE orchestrators that spawn multiple sub-agents via Task tool
- Use /building-claude-code-skills methodology — Follow the official skill-building patterns
**Depends on**: Nothing
**Requirements**: None (infrastructure improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. 8 skills created: kata-planning-phases, kata-execution, kata-verification, kata-starting-new-projects, kata-manageing-milestones, kata-managing-project-roadmap, kata-researching-phases, kata-utility
  2. Each skill has SKILL.md (<500 lines) with proper frontmatter (name, description only)
  3. Each skill has references/ subdirectory for progressive disclosure
  4. Skills spawn sub-agents via Task tool (skills ARE orchestrators)
  5. Installation script updated to copy skills/ directory
  6. CLAUDE.md updated to document skills architecture
**Plans**: 12 plans (9 original + 3 gap closure)

### Phase 1: Migrate Todo Commands to Kata Skill

**Goal**: Create `kata-managing-todos` skill to handle todo capture and management, migrating functionality from GSD's `add-todo` and `check-todos` commands
**Depends on**: Phase 0 (Skills established)
**Requirements**: None (skill migration)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. kata-managing-todos skill created with SKILL.md (<500 lines)
  2. Skill has references/ subdirectory (todo-format.md, actions.md)
  3. ADD operation captures todos with area inference and duplicate detection
  4. CHECK operation lists pending todos with action options (work on, add to phase, create phase, brainstorm, put back)
  5. STATE.md updated on todo add/complete
  6. Installation verified with natural language triggers
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Create SKILL.md with operation detection and ADD operation
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Add CHECK operation and references/actions.md
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Verify installation and natural language triggers (renamed to kata-managing-todos)

### Phase 1.1: Testing & Evals Harness (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Create a CLI-based testing framework that leverages Claude Code's command-line instantiation (`claude "prompt"`) to programmatically test Kata skills and commands
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (Todo skill exists for test subject)
**Requirements**: None (infrastructure improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Test harness script(s) can invoke `claude "prompt"` with controlled inputs
  2. Outcome parser scripts verify: skill invoked? correct artifacts produced?
  3. At least one skill covered by automated test (proof of concept)
  4. Tests can run in CI-like environment (no interactive prompts)
  5. Clear pass/fail reporting for UAT efficiency
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01.1-01-PLAN.md — Create test harness utilities (claude-cli.js, assertions.js) and fixtures
- [x] 01.1-02-PLAN.md — Create proof-of-concept skill test + npm integration

### Phase 1.2: Skill Tests (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Write comprehensive tests for all 10 kata skills using the test harness, ensuring skills trigger correctly on natural language prompts
**Depends on**: Phase 1.1 (Test harness exists)
**Requirements**: None (testing improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Test files exist for all 10 kata skills
  2. Each skill has at least one trigger test (natural language → skill invocation)
  3. Tests verify num_turns > 1 (skill actually ran)
  4. All tests pass (`npm test` succeeds)
  5. Single-skill test command works (`npm run test:skill -- tests/skills/<name>.test.js`)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01.2-01-PLAN.md — Create tests for debugging, execution, and milestone skills
- [x] 01.2-02-PLAN.md — Create tests for roadmap, planning, and progress skills
- [x] 01.2-03-PLAN.md — Create tests for research, new project, and verification skills
- [x] 01.2-04-PLAN.md — Verify all 10 tests exist and npm test works

### Phase 1.3: Discuss Phase Skill (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Create `kata-discussing-phase-context` skill to gather user's vision and implementation decisions before planning, producing CONTEXT.md that downstream agents (researcher, planner) use
**Depends on**: Phase 1.2 (Skill test patterns established)
**Requirements**: None (skill gap closure)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. kata-discussing-phase-context skill created with SKILL.md (<500 lines)
  2. Skill has references/ subdirectory for progressive disclosure
  3. Skill analyzes phase to identify domain-specific gray areas
  4. Skill conducts adaptive questioning (4 questions per area, offer more/next)
  5. Skill enforces scope guardrail (clarifies HOW, not WHETHER to add more)
  6. Skill writes {phase}-CONTEXT.md with decisions that guide research/planning
  7. Skill offers next steps (research or plan)
  8. Test file created for skill trigger verification
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01.3-01-PLAN.md — Create skill with SKILL.md and references/
- [x] 01.3-02-PLAN.md — Create test file and verify installation

### Phase 2: Create Kata Slash Commands

**Goal**: Create GSD-equivalent slash commands that instantiate corresponding Kata skills, ensuring explicit invocation path alongside autonomous skill triggering
**Depends on**: Phase 0 (Skills exist), Phase 1.1 (Testing harness exists for verification)
**Requirements**: None (usability improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Kata slash commands created for all GSD command equivalents (25 commands)
  2. Each command has `disable-model-invocation: true` in frontmatter
  3. Each corresponding Kata skill has `user-invocable: false` in frontmatter
  4. Commands delegate to skills (thin wrappers that instantiate skill workflows)
  5. Gap skills created for any GSD commands without Kata skill equivalents
  6. NextUp tables updated to show `/kata-{command}` explicit invocation format
  7. README documentation updated with command reference
**Plans**: 7 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Create 3 gap skills (update, quick, help)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Create project and milestone commands (7 commands)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Create roadmap and research commands (7 commands)
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Create planning, execution, session, todo commands (8 commands)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 1.1: Testing & Evals Harness (inserted after Phase 1 for test infrastructure)
- Phase 1.2: Skill Tests (inserted to test all skills)
- Phase 1.3: Discuss Phase Skill (inserted to close gap in pre-planning context gathering)

**Key Decisions:**
- Skills as orchestrators — Skills contain full workflow logic and spawn sub-agents via Task tool
- Skill naming convention — Gerund (verb-ing) style names with exhaustive trigger phrases
- ESM module type — Added "type": "module" to package.json for test harness
- Command delegation pattern — All slash commands use disable-model-invocation: true
- Skill invocation control — Added user-invocable: false to prevent autonomous invocation

**Issues Resolved:**
- Skill trigger reliability improved via exhaustive trigger phrases
- Gap skills (update, quick, help) added for feature parity with GSD commands
- Research workflow clarified with tripartite split (discuss, research, assumptions)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Skill tests need updating after Phase 2 refactor (removed from milestone)
- Documentation phase removed (README covers essentials)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
