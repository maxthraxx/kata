# Phase 01.3 Plan 02: Discuss Phase Skill Tests Summary

**Created test file for kata-discussing-phase-context skill verifying 3 trigger phrases using established test harness patterns**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T22:54:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T22:56:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Created test file following established pattern from kata-researching-phases.test.js
- Test covers 3 trigger phrases: "discuss phase", "gather context for phase", "what should phase look like"
- Verified skill installs correctly via `node bin/install.js --local`
- Test file syntax validated without errors

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create skill test file** - `b37e218` (test)
2. **Task 2: Verify skill installation and test execution** - verification only (no commit)

## Files Created/Modified

- `tests/skills/kata-discussing-phase-context.test.js` - Skill trigger verification tests (79 lines)

## Decisions Made

- **3 trigger phrases:** Selected "discuss phase", "gather context for phase", and "what should phase look like" as representative triggers from skill description
- **Reused pattern:** Followed exact structure from kata-researching-phases.test.js for consistency

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 01.3 complete with skill and tests
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Kata Slash Commands)
- All 11 kata skills now have test coverage
