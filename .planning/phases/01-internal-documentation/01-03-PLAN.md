<objective>
Fix the overly dense orchestration diagram in Section 1 of FLOWS.md by simplifying the node structure to improve readability.

**Purpose:** Address UAT Issue #1 — diagram has too many nodes (15+ agents), making elements too small to read.

**Output:** Readable orchestration diagram that clearly shows the skill → agent spawning pattern without overwhelming detail.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Simplify orchestration diagram structure</name>
  <files>.docs/diagrams/FLOWS.md</files>
  <action>
Edit Section 1 (High-Level Orchestration) only. Choose ONE of these approaches:

**Option A: Core agents only with note**
- Reduce to 3-4 most representative agents per skill (e.g., planning-phases → planner, checker; executing-phases → executor; verifying-work → verifier, debugger)
- Add note after diagram: "Note: Additional specialized agents exist for specific workflows (e.g., kata-pr-test-analyzer, kata-type-design-analyzer). See GLOSSARY.md for complete list."

**Option B: Split into multiple focused diagrams**
- Create separate subsections: "1a. Core Workflows", "1b. PR Review Workflow", "1c. Advanced Workflows"
- Each diagram shows only relevant skills and agents
- Keep total node count under 12 per diagram

**Option C: Horizontal layout**
- Change `flowchart TD` to `flowchart LR` (left-to-right)
- Horizontal layouts handle density better for wide relationships
- Group agents vertically within their skill context

Choose the option that best balances readability with completeness. DO NOT change content in other sections (2-6).
  </action>
  <verify>Open .docs/diagrams/FLOWS.md in GitHub preview or Mermaid Live Editor — Section 1 diagram should be readable with elements large enough to read comfortably</verify>
  <done>Section 1 diagram has fewer than 12 nodes OR uses horizontal layout, elements are clearly readable</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Read .docs/diagrams/FLOWS.md Section 1
2. Verify diagram syntax is valid Mermaid
3. Verify content accuracy (skills spawn correct agents)
4. Verify readability improvement (fewer nodes or better layout)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Section 1 diagram structure simplified
- [ ] Diagram elements are readable (not too small)
- [ ] Content remains accurate (correct skill → agent relationships)
- [ ] Other sections (2-6) unchanged
- [ ] Mermaid syntax valid
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-internal-documentation/01-03-SUMMARY.md`
