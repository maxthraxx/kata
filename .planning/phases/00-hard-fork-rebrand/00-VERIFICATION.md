**Score:** 15/15 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `package.json` | Package identity with gannonh | VERIFIED | name=kata-cli, version=0.1.0, author=gannonh, repo=gannonh/kata |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Standalone project instructions | VERIFIED | 12 lines, describes feature branch workflow |
| `README.md` | Project documentation | VERIFIED | 471 lines, kata-cli references, gannonh/kata URLs |
| `bin/install.js` | CLI installer | VERIFIED | 570 lines, no TACHES, clean banner |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history | VERIFIED | Fresh v0.1.0 entry, gannonh/kata URLs |
| `commands/kata/update.md` | Update command | VERIFIED | 173 lines, uses gannonh/kata URLs |
| `commands/kata/whats-new.md` | What's new command | VERIFIED | 125 lines, uses gannonh/kata URLs |
| `hooks/kata-check-update.js` | Update check hook | VERIFIED | 52 lines, checks kata-cli on npm |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| package.json repository.url | git remote origin | matching repo URL | VERIFIED | Both point to gannonh/kata |
| README.md | package.json | consistent package name | VERIFIED | Both use kata-cli |
| commands/kata/update.md | npm registry | kata-cli package name | VERIFIED | Uses `npm view kata-cli` |
| CHANGELOG.md compare URLs | git repository | GitHub repo reference | VERIFIED | github.com/gannonh/kata |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| All glittercowboy references removed | SATISFIED | Comprehensive grep confirms 0 matches outside Phase 0 docs |
| Project branding Kata by gannonh | SATISFIED | package.json, README, install banner all consistent |
| Git history preserved, upstream removed | SATISFIED | Only origin remote exists, history intact |
| CLAUDE.md updated for standalone | SATISFIED | Rewritten with simple workflow, no upstream refs |
| Package author/repository updated | SATISFIED | author=gannonh, repository=gannonh/kata |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| None detected | - | - | - | - |

**Comprehensive scans performed:**
- `grep -r "glittercowboy"` outside Phase 0 docs: Only found in STATE.md/ROADMAP.md status entries (acceptable)
- `grep -ri "TACHES"` outside Phase 0 docs: No matches
- `grep -r "get-shit-done"` outside Phase 0 docs: Found in CONCERNS.md as local path only (acceptable)

### Human Verification Required

1. **Install Banner Visual Check**
   - **Test:** Run `npx kata-cli` and observe the banner
   - **Expected:** Kata ASCII art displays, version shows 0.1.0, no TACHES attribution
   - **Why human:** Visual appearance verification

2. **README Link Verification**
   - **Test:** Open README.md and click all GitHub links
   - **Expected:** All links resolve to gannonh/kata repository
   - **Why human:** Requires HTTP requests to verify link targets

3. **npm Package Name Verification**
   - **Test:** Run `npm view kata-cli` after publishing
   - **Expected:** Package exists under kata-cli name with gannonh as author
   - **Why human:** Package not yet published

### Notes

**Local Directory Name:**
The codebase lives in a directory named `get-shit-done` on the developer's machine (`/Users/gannonhall/dev/oss/gsd-dev/get-shit-done/`). This appears in:
- `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md` line 34 (auto-generated by map-codebase)

This is NOT a branding issue - it's the local filesystem path. The project identity in all shipped code is correctly "Kata" with gannonh ownership.

**Phase 0 Documentation:**
The `.planning/phases/00-hard-fork-rebrand/` directory intentionally contains references to the old project (glittercowboy, TACHES, get-shit-done) in:
- `00-RESEARCH.md` - Documents what was changed
- `00-*-PLAN.md` - Describes tasks to remove old refs
- `00-*-SUMMARY.md` - Confirms what was updated

These are historical records of the rebrand, not stale references.
