<objective>
Extend the existing test harness with affected-test detection and additional assertions.

Purpose: Enable efficient CI testing (only run tests for changed skills) and provide assertions specific to Kata's deterministic outputs (next-step proposals, file structures).

Output: Extended harness ready for skill test files.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create affected.js for git-diff-based test filtering</name>
  <files>tests/harness/affected.js</files>
  <action>
Create `tests/harness/affected.js` that detects which skills changed based on git diff:

1. Export `getAffectedSkills(baseBranch = 'origin/main')`:
   - Run `git diff --name-only ${baseBranch}...HEAD`
   - Parse changed files to identify affected skills
   - Direct skill changes: `skills/kata-{name}/` -> skill affected
   - Agent changes: `agents/kata-{agent}.md` -> find skills that spawn that agent
   - Return array of skill names (e.g., ['kata-tracking-progress', 'kata-adding-phases'])

2. Export `getAffectedTestFiles(baseBranch = 'origin/main')`:
   - Call getAffectedSkills()
   - Map skill names to test file paths: `kata-{name}` -> `tests/skills/{name}.test.js`
   - Filter to only return files that exist
   - Return array of test file paths

3. Export `getSkillsUsingAgent(agentName)`:
   - Scan all SKILL.md files for agent references
   - Return skills that reference the given agent
   - Cache results for efficiency

Use `node:child_process` execSync and `node:fs` for file operations. Handle cases where git diff returns empty or fails gracefully.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run in shell:
```bash
node -e "import('./tests/harness/affected.js').then(m => console.log(m.getAffectedSkills()))"
```
Should return array (possibly empty if no uncommitted changes).
  </verify>
  <done>affected.js exports getAffectedSkills() and getAffectedTestFiles() that parse git diff to identify changed skills</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Extend assertions.js with skill-specific assertions</name>
  <files>tests/harness/assertions.js</files>
  <action>
Add two new assertions to the existing `tests/harness/assertions.js`:

1. `assertNextStepProposed(result, expectedCommand)`:
   - Look for Kata's "Next Up" section pattern in result.result
   - Match pattern: `/## ▶ Next Up[\s\S]*?(\/kata:[a-z-]+)/i`
   - Assert the matched command includes expectedCommand
   - Provide clear error message if pattern not found or command doesn't match

2. `assertFileStructure(basePath, expectedPaths)`:
   - Take base directory and array of relative paths
   - Check each path exists using existsSync
   - Collect all missing paths
   - Assert with error listing all missing paths if any

Import `existsSync` from 'node:fs' (already imported). Keep existing assertions unchanged.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run assertions.js with a simple import test:
```bash
node -e "import('./tests/harness/assertions.js').then(m => console.log(Object.keys(m)))"
```
Should list all exports including assertNextStepProposed and assertFileStructure.
  </verify>
  <done>assertions.js has assertNextStepProposed() and assertFileStructure() for testing Kata's deterministic outputs</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update tests/README.md with new patterns</name>
  <files>tests/README.md</files>
  <action>
Update tests/README.md to document:

1. Add "Affected Test Detection" section:
   - Explain getAffectedSkills() and getAffectedTestFiles()
   - Show usage example for running only affected tests
   - Document agent-to-skill mapping

2. Update "Assertions" table:
   - Add assertNextStepProposed(result, command) row
   - Add assertFileStructure(basePath, paths) row

3. Add "CI Integration" section:
   - Reference the GitHub workflow (to be created in Plan 07)
   - Explain cost control via affected tests
   - Document ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret requirement

4. Add "Writing Skill Tests" guidance:
   - Recommend testing structural outputs, not prose
   - Show assertNextStepProposed example
   - Explain test isolation best practices

Keep existing content, add new sections logically.
  </action>
  <verify>Read updated README.md and confirm new sections exist.</verify>
  <done>README.md documents affected-test detection, new assertions, and CI patterns</done>
</task>
