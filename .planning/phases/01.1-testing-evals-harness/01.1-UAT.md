## Tests

### 1. npm test runs and passes
expected: Run `npm test` from project root. Should discover 3 tests and all pass (duration ~70s).
result: pass

### 2. Test isolation works
expected: Running tests does NOT modify files in your actual project. Tests use temp directories.
result: pass

### 3. Skill invocation detected
expected: Tests correctly identify when a skill is invoked (num_turns > 1 in JSON response).
result: pass

### 4. Todo file created by ADD operation
expected: The ADD test creates a todo file in the temp project's `.planning/todos/pending/` directory.
result: pass
