# Phase 02.2 Plan 03: Remove Commands Layer Summary

Delete commands layer and update documentation for skills-only architecture

## What Was Delivered

1. **Deleted commands/kata/ directory (27 files)**
   - All command wrapper files removed
   - commands/ directory itself removed (only contained kata/)

2. **Updated build.js**
   - Removed 'commands/kata' from COMMON_INCLUDES
   - Removed 'commands/kata/update.md' from PLUGIN_EXCLUDES

3. **Updated README.md documentation**
   - Renamed "Commands" section to "Skills"
   - Added invocation syntax table (plugin vs NPX)
   - Updated all command references to skill names
   - Updated troubleshooting section for skills

4. **Updated CLAUDE.md architecture documentation**
   - Skills now listed as primary interface
   - Removed "Skills vs Commands" comparison table
   - Updated installation verification instructions
   - Updated available skills table with invocation syntax

## Changes Made

| File | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| `commands/kata/*.md` | Deleted (27 files) |
| `README.md` | Rewritten Commands section as Skills section |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Updated architecture to reflect skills-only |
| `scripts/build.js` | Removed commands from COMMON_INCLUDES |

## Verification Results

- [x] commands/kata/ directory deleted
- [x] node scripts/build.js all succeeds
- [x] dist/plugin/skills/ shows skills without kata- prefix
- [x] dist/npm/skills/ shows skills with kata- prefix
- [x] README.md documents new invocation syntax
- [x] CLAUDE.md reflects skills-only architecture
- [x] All changes committed

## Commits

| Hash | Message |
| ---- | ------- |
| 5744503 | feat(02.2-03): remove commands layer, update documentation |

## Breaking Change

This is a **BREAKING CHANGE**:
- Old syntax: `/kata:phase-plan 2`
- New syntax (plugin): `/kata:planning-phases 2`
- New syntax (NPX): `/kata-planning-phases 2`

The migration is automatic for plugin users (build.js transforms skill names).
NPX users must update their invocation patterns.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 02.2 (Normalize on Skills) is now complete:
- Plan 01: Skills made user-invocable
- Plan 02: Build.js transforms skill prefixes for plugin
- Plan 03: Commands layer removed, documentation updated

Ready for v1.0.9 release.
