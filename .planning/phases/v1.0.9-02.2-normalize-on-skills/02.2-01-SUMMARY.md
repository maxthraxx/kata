# Phase 02.2 Plan 01: Make Skills User-Invocable Summary

**Updated all 27 skills to user-invocable: true for direct / menu invocation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T04:44:22Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T04:45:22Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 27

## Accomplishments

- Changed `user-invocable: false` to `user-invocable: true` in all 27 skill frontmatter files
- Skills now appear in the `/` slash command menu
- Skills can be invoked directly: `/kata-planning-phases` (npx) or `/kata:planning-phases` (plugin)
- Natural language invocation still works via skill descriptions

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update all skill frontmatter** - `5d522b4` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Commit changes** - same commit (combined)

## Skills Updated (27 total)

## Decisions Made

- **Single frontmatter line change:** Changed `user-invocable: false` to `user-invocable: true` rather than removing the line (explicit is better than implicit default)
- **All skills made user-invocable:** No exceptions - all 27 skills will be directly accessible once commands are removed

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - changes take effect when skills are installed.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All skills now user-invocable
- Ready for plan 02: Remove commands directory (skills are now the primary entry point)
- Ready for plan 03: Update build.js for skill-only distribution
