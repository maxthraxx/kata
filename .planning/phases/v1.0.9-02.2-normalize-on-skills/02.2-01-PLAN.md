<objective>
Make all 27 Kata skills user-invocable by removing `user-invocable: false` from their frontmatter.

Purpose: Skills currently hidden from the `/` menu because commands were the intended entry point. With commands being removed, skills need to be directly invocable.

Output: 27 SKILL.md files updated with `user-invocable: true` (or line removed entirely since `true` is the default).
</objective>

<context>
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@.planning/STATE.md

**Current state:**
- All 27 skills have `user-invocable: false` in frontmatter line 5
- This hides them from the `/` slash command menu
- Users currently invoke via `/kata:command-name` which delegates to the skill

**Target state:**
- All skills have `user-invocable: true` (or omit the line since `true` is default)
- Skills appear in `/` menu and can be invoked directly
- NPX: `/kata-planning-phases`
- Plugin: `/kata:planning-phases` (after build.js strips prefix)

**Skills to update (27 total):**
- kata-adding-phases

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update all skill frontmatter to user-invocable: true</name>
  <files>All 27 SKILL.md files in skills/kata-*/</files>
  <action>
For each of the 27 skills in `skills/kata-*/SKILL.md`:

1. Read the file
2. Find line 5 which contains `user-invocable: false`
3. Change it to `user-invocable: true`

Use a script or loop to update all files efficiently:

```bash
for skill in skills/kata-*/SKILL.md; do
  sed -i '' 's/user-invocable: false/user-invocable: true/' "$skill"
done
```

Verify the change was applied to all files:

```bash
grep -c "user-invocable: true" skills/kata-*/SKILL.md | wc -l
# Should output 27
```
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Verify all skills now have user-invocable: true
grep "user-invocable: true" skills/kata-*/SKILL.md | wc -l
# Expected: 27

# Verify no skills have user-invocable: false
grep "user-invocable: false" skills/kata-*/SKILL.md
# Expected: no output
```
  </verify>
  <done>All 27 SKILL.md files have `user-invocable: true` in frontmatter</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Commit skill frontmatter changes</name>
  <files>skills/kata-*/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Stage and commit the skill changes:

```bash
git add skills/kata-*/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(02.2-01): make all skills user-invocable

- Updated 27 skills to user-invocable: true
- Skills now appear in / menu for direct invocation
- Prepares for command layer removal
