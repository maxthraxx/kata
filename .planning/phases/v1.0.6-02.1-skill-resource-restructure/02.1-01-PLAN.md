<objective>
Copy shared resources into skills that depend on kata/ directory.

Purpose: Enable skills to be self-contained by bundling all required resources within each skill's own `references/` subdirectory.

Output: All skills with external dependencies now have their own `references/` folders containing copies of the files they need.

All 10 skills with external kata/ dependencies now have their own references/ subdirectories containing copies of required resources:
- kata-executing-phases (3 files)
- kata-planning-phases (1 file)
- kata-starting-projects (4 files)
- kata-starting-milestones (4 files)
- kata-verifying-work (2 files)
- kata-completing-milestones (2 files)

<success_criteria>
- [ ] All 10 skill directories have references/ subdirectories
- [ ] Each references/ contains the files that skill needs (per research matrix)
- [ ] Templates renamed with `-template` suffix
- [ ] No files missing from the copy operations
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/v1.0.6-02.1-skill-resource-restructure/02.1-01-SUMMARY.md`
