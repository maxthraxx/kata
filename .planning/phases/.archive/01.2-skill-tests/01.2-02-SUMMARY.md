# Phase 01.2 Plan 02: Skill Trigger Tests (Batch 2) Summary

**Test files for roadmap, planning, and progress skills with 10 total trigger tests covering ADD/INSERT, phase planning, and status operations**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T21:34:51Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T21:36:06Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3 created

## Accomplishments
- Created kata-managing-project-roadmap.test.js with 3 trigger tests (ADD + INSERT operations)
- Created kata-planning-phases.test.js with 3 trigger tests (planning workflow)
- Created kata-providing-progress-and-status-updates.test.js with 4 trigger tests (PROGRESS operation)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create kata-managing-project-roadmap.test.js** - `622afa1` (test)
2. **Task 2: Create kata-planning-phases.test.js** - `b1f35c5` (test)
3. **Task 3: Create kata-providing-progress-and-status-updates.test.js** - `63a639a` (test)

## Files Created/Modified
- `tests/skills/kata-managing-project-roadmap.test.js` - ADD/INSERT operation trigger tests (81 lines)
- `tests/skills/kata-planning-phases.test.js` - Planning workflow trigger tests (79 lines)
- `tests/skills/kata-providing-progress-and-status-updates.test.js` - Progress/status trigger tests (90 lines)

## Decisions Made
- Used trigger phrases directly from each skill's SKILL.md description field for realistic test coverage
- Focused on primary operations per skill (ADD/INSERT for roadmap, planning for phases, PROGRESS for status)

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- 4 skill test files now complete (kata-managing-todos + 3 from this plan)
- Ready for plan 03: remaining skills batch
