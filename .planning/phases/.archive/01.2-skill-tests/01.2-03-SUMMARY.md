# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.1-testing-evals-harness
    provides: claude-cli.js test harness and assertions library
  - phase: 01.2-skill-tests (plan 01)
    provides: kata-managing-todos.test.js reference pattern
provides:
  - kata-researching-phases.test.js with 3 trigger tests (research, investigate, discuss)
  - kata-starting-project-news.test.js with 3 trigger tests (new project, start, initialize)
  - kata-verifying-work-outcomes-and-user-acceptance-testing.test.js with 3 trigger tests (uat, verify, did it work)
affects: [01.2-skill-tests remaining plans, skill verification workflows]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Same test pattern extended to research/project/verification skills

key-files:
  created:
    - tests/skills/kata-researching-phases.test.js
    - tests/skills/kata-starting-project-news.test.js
    - tests/skills/kata-verifying-work-outcomes-and-user-acceptance-testing.test.js
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "Used 'kata uat' phrasing in test to avoid triggering test suite runner"
  - "Grouped tests by operation type (Research/Discuss, Project init, UAT/Goal-backward)"

patterns-established:
  - "Skill test file naming: kata-{skill-name}.test.js"
  - "Test structure: beforeEach installs skill, afterEach cleans up, describe groups by operation"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 03: Skill Tests Batch 3 Summary

**9 trigger tests for kata-researching-phases, kata-starting-project-news, and kata-verification skills following established pattern**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T21:34:51Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T21:36:06Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files created:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Created kata-researching-phases.test.js with Research and Discuss operation tests
- Created kata-starting-project-news.test.js with initialization workflow tests
- Created kata-verifying-work-outcomes-and-user-acceptance-testing.test.js with UAT and goal-backward verification tests
- All files pass syntax check (node --check)
- All files exceed 30 line minimum (81, 79, 82 lines respectively)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create kata-researching-phases.test.js** - `df835f7` (test)
2. **Task 2: Create kata-starting-project-news.test.js** - `46c4544` (test)
3. **Task 3: Create kata-verifying-work-outcomes-and-user-acceptance-testing.test.js** - `9772ce9` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `tests/skills/kata-researching-phases.test.js` - Tests for research/investigate/discuss triggers
- `tests/skills/kata-starting-project-news.test.js` - Tests for new project/start/initialize triggers
- `tests/skills/kata-verifying-work-outcomes-and-user-acceptance-testing.test.js` - Tests for UAT/verify/did-it-work triggers

## Decisions Made

- Used "run kata uat" instead of just "run uat" to avoid triggering test suite runner
- Grouped tests by operation type within each test file (Research vs Discuss, UAT vs Goal-backward)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- 3 more skills have trigger tests (9 total tests added this plan)
- Pattern established and repeatable for remaining skills
- Ready for Plan 04 (next batch of skills)
