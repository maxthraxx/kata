# Phase 01.2 Plan 01: Skill Tests Batch 1 Summary

**First batch of skill trigger tests: debugging (3 tests), execution (4 tests), milestones (7 tests) using node:test and CLI harness**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T13:33:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T13:36:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3 (all created)

## Accomplishments
- Created trigger tests for kata-debugging-kata-workflow-issues skill (3 tests)
- Created trigger tests for kata-executing-project-phases skill (4 tests)
- Created trigger tests for kata-manageing-milestones skill (7 tests)
- All 14 tests follow established pattern from kata-managing-todos.test.js

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create kata-debugging-kata-workflow-issues.test.js** - `ceb2b7e` (test)
2. **Task 2: Create kata-executing-project-phases.test.js** - `f7c54c2` (test)
3. **Task 3: Create kata-manageing-milestones.test.js** - `73830cb` (test)

## Files Created/Modified
- `tests/skills/kata-debugging-kata-workflow-issues.test.js` - Tests DEBUG-KATA operation triggers (plan failed, kata isn't working, execution stuck)
- `tests/skills/kata-executing-project-phases.test.js` - Tests execution workflow triggers (execute phase, start phase, run plans, build phase)
- `tests/skills/kata-manageing-milestones.test.js` - Tests NEW/COMPLETE/AUDIT operation triggers (7 total tests)

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- First batch of skill tests complete
- Ready for 01.2-02 (next batch: researching, project-status, planning skills)
- Test harness verified working with skill pattern
