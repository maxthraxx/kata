<objective>
Create the three gap skills needed before slash commands can be created for all GSD command equivalents.

Purpose: Cover the 4 utility commands that have no Kata skill equivalent (help, quick, update, whats-new)
Output: Three new skills in skills/ directory following established patterns

  <files>skills/kata-updating-to-latest-version/SKILL.md, skills/kata-updating-to-latest-version/references/version-detection.md</files>
  <action>
Create skill directory and SKILL.md following established patterns.

**Frontmatter:**
- name: kata-updating-to-latest-version
- description: Include triggers for "update kata", "update to latest", "whats new", "what's new", "show changelog", "version", "kata version", "check for updates"

**SKILL.md content:**
1. Workflow Overview section showing: detect context (update vs whats-new) → version detection → display/action
2. Step 1: Parse context - determine if user wants update or whats-new
3. Step 2: Read installed version from ~/.claude/kata/VERSION
4. Step 3: Check npm for latest version using `npm view @gannonh/kata version`
5. Step 4a: For UPDATE - if newer version available, provide npx command to update
6. Step 4b: For WHATS-NEW - read CHANGELOG.md and display changes since installed version
7. Step 5: Display results with clear formatting

**references/version-detection.md:**
- Semver comparison logic
- npm registry API patterns
- CHANGELOG.md parsing (version headers like "## v1.2.3")

  <action>
Create skill directory and SKILL.md.

**Frontmatter:**
- name: kata-executing-task-executes
- description: Include triggers for "quick", "quick task", "do this quickly", "fast task", "skip research", "just do it", "simple task", "one-off task"

**SKILL.md content:**
1. Purpose: Execute small tasks with Kata guarantees (atomic commits) but skip optional agents
2. When to Use: Task is small, well-defined, doesn't need research or verification
3. Constraints: Single commit, no sub-agents, direct execution
4. Workflow:
   - Parse task description from user
   - Execute task directly (no research, no planner)
   - Create atomic commit with descriptive message
   - Report completion
5. Anti-patterns: Don't use for multi-file changes, don't use for uncertain requirements

**references/task-constraints.md:**
- Size heuristics (< 3 files, < 30 min)
- When to escalate to full planning
- Commit message format for quick tasks

- description: Include triggers for "kata help", "help with kata", "show commands", "kata commands", "what commands", "how to use kata", "kata usage", "kata guide", "kata documentation"

**SKILL.md content:**
1. Purpose: Display available Kata commands and usage guide
2. Workflow:
   - Detect if user wants: command list, specific command help, or general usage
   - For command list: Display all /kata: commands with descriptions
   - For specific help: Show command details, arguments, examples
   - For general usage: Show workflow overview (plan → execute → verify)
3. Command Categories:
   - Project: project-new, project-status
   - Milestones: milestone-new, milestone-complete, milestone-audit
   - Roadmap: phase-add, phase-insert, phase-remove, roadmap-plan-gaps
   - Research: phase-discuss, phase-research, phase-assumptions
   - Planning: phase-plan
   - Execution: phase-execute, quick
   - Verification: work-verify
   - Session: work-pause, work-resume
   - Utilities: codebase-map, todos-add, todo-check, workflow-debug, help, update, whats-new

- Common workflows (new project, build feature, debug issue)
