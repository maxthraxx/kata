# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 00-convert-commands-skills
    provides: Skill architecture and patterns
provides:
  - kata-updating-to-latest-version skill (update, whats-new, version-check)
  - kata-executing-task-executes skill (quick task execution without planning)
  - kata-showing-available-commands-and-usage-guides skill (command reference and help)
affects: [02-create-kata-slash-commands, slash-command-tests, documentation]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Version detection and semver comparison for updates
    - Quick task constraint validation (size, clarity, scope)
    - Multi-context help routing (command-list, specific-command, usage-guide, features)

key-decisions:
  - "Multi-intent skills: kata-updating-to-latest-version handles update, whats-new, and version-check intents"
  - "Quick task validation: <30 min, ≤3 files, no architecture decisions"
  - "Help context routing: command-list, specific-command, usage-guide, feature-overview"

patterns-established:
  - "npm registry integration for version checks: npm view @gannonh/kata version"
  - "CHANGELOG.md parsing by version headers for release notes"
  - "Quick task escalation decision tree with fail-fast principle"
  - "Progressive help disclosure: list → specific → guide → features"

# Phase 02 Plan 01: Gap Skills Summary

**Three utility skills covering update/version management, quick task execution, and command reference/help**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T00:20:08Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T00:26:09Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Version management skill with npm registry integration and changelog parsing
- Quick task execution skill with constraint validation and atomic commit workflow
- Command reference skill with categorized help and usage guides
- Complete reference documentation for all three skills

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create kata-updating-to-latest-version skill** - `ca3c922` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create kata-executing-task-executes skill** - `4e36d68` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create kata-showing-available-commands-and-usage-guides skill** - `4253389` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (pending - to be committed with STATE.md update)

## Files Created/Modified

- `skills/kata-updating-to-latest-version/SKILL.md` - Version detection, update workflow, changelog display
- `skills/kata-updating-to-latest-version/references/version-detection.md` - Semver comparison, npm API, CHANGELOG parsing
- `skills/kata-executing-task-executes/SKILL.md` - Quick task orchestration with size/scope constraints
- `skills/kata-executing-task-executes/references/task-constraints.md` - Validation heuristics, escalation rules, commit guidelines
- `skills/kata-showing-available-commands-and-usage-guides/SKILL.md` - Multi-context help routing and display
- `skills/kata-showing-available-commands-and-usage-guides/references/command-reference.md` - Complete command documentation with workflows and tips

## Decisions Made

**Multi-intent skill pattern:**
- kata-updating-to-latest-version handles three related intents (UPDATE, WHATS-NEW, VERSION-CHECK) in single skill
- Command name provides context for which action to perform
- Reduces skill proliferation while maintaining clear separation of concerns

**Quick task constraints:**
- Time: <30 minutes
- Files: ≤3 files
- Complexity: No architecture decisions, no new dependencies, no breaking changes
- Escalation: Fail fast with user confirmation if constraints violated

**Help context routing:**
- Four help contexts: COMMAND_LIST, SPECIFIC_COMMAND, USAGE_GUIDE, FEATURE_OVERVIEW
- Progressive disclosure from overview to specifics
- Complete command reference in references/ for deep dives

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for:**
- Phase 02-02: Create slash commands that instantiate these skills
- Slash command tests (Phase 2.1)
- Documentation updates with new commands

**No blockers or concerns**
