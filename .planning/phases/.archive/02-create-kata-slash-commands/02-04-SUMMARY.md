# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 00-convert-commands-skills
    provides: Core Kata skills (planning, execution, verification, todos, status)
  - phase: 02-01
    provides: Gap skills (discussing phases, quick tasks, updating)
provides:
  - 8 slash commands for explicit skill invocation
  - Command-to-skill delegation pattern
  - Explicit invocation paths for core workflows
affects: [02-05, testing, documentation]

  - "Command pattern: Validate → Delegate to skill → Pass through results"
  - "Frontmatter includes name, description, argument-hint, allowed-tools, disable-model-invocation"

# Phase 2 Plan 4: Create Kata Slash Commands Summary

**8 slash commands created for explicit invocation of planning, execution, verification, session management, and todo workflows**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T00:28:24Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T00:31:24Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 8

## Accomplishments
- Created 3 core workflow commands (phase-plan, phase-execute, work-verify)
- Created 5 session and todo commands (work-pause, work-resume, codebase-map, todos-add, todo-check)
- All commands delegate to corresponding skills with proper frontmatter
- Commands provide explicit invocation paths alongside autonomous skill triggering

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create core workflow commands** - `acd0a64` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create session and todo commands** - `3622a6b` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `commands/kata/phase-plan.md` - Delegates to kata-planning-phases skill
- `commands/kata/phase-execute.md` - Delegates to kata-executing-project-phases skill
- `commands/kata/work-verify.md` - Delegates to kata-verifying-work-outcomes-and-user-acceptance-testing skill
- `commands/kata/work-pause.md` - Delegates to kata-providing-progress-and-status-updates (pause operation)
- `commands/kata/work-resume.md` - Delegates to kata-providing-progress-and-status-updates (resume operation)
- `commands/kata/codebase-map.md` - Delegates to kata-providing-progress-and-status-updates (project-analyze operation)
- `commands/kata/todos-add.md` - Delegates to kata-managing-todos skill (add operation)
- `commands/kata/todo-check.md` - Delegates to kata-managing-todos skill (check operation)

## Decisions Made
- **disable-model-invocation: true** - All commands use this flag to prevent autonomous model decision-making, ensuring deterministic execution
- **Task tool delegation** - Commands use Task tool to spawn skills (not direct skill invocation)
- **Pass-through pattern** - Commands return skill results directly without modification
- **Empty argument-hint for no-arg commands** - Using `""` instead of omitting the field

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All 8 slash commands available for deterministic invocation
- Ready for 02-05 (remaining slash commands) or testing phase
- Commands complement autonomous skill triggering by providing explicit invocation paths
- Total of 22 commands now available (7 from previous work + 7 from 02-03 + 8 from this plan)
