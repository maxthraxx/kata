<objective>
Create the kata-manageing-milestones skill for milestone operations.

Purpose: Handles new milestone creation, milestone completion/archiving, and milestone auditing to identify gaps.

Output: skills/kata-manageing-milestones/ directory with SKILL.md and references/

  <action>
Create the kata-manageing-milestones skill following /building-claude-code-skills methodology:

1. Create skills/kata-manageing-milestones/SKILL.md:
   - Frontmatter: name (kata-manageing-milestones), description (trigger-focused, 3rd person)
   - Description includes: "new milestone", "create milestone", "complete milestone", "finish milestone", "audit milestone", "check milestone", "milestone gaps", "archive milestone"
   - NO allowed-tools, model, agent, context fields
   - Core workflow (~400 lines max):
     * Determine operation from natural language (new, complete, audit)
     * For NEW milestone:
       - Discovery interview for milestone vision
       - Derive requirements from vision
       - Create phases from requirements
       - Spawn kata-roadmapper to create ROADMAP.md updates
     * For COMPLETE milestone:
       - Verify all phases complete
       - Archive ROADMAP.md to milestones/ directory
       - Update STATE.md
       - Generate completion summary
     * For AUDIT milestone:
       - Load current requirements and phases
       - Check coverage (requirements -> phases mapping)
       - Identify gaps (requirements without phases)
       - Generate audit report
       - Offer gap remediation
   - Reference supporting files with relative paths

2. Create references/milestone-creation.md:
   - Milestone vision interview
   - Requirements derivation from vision
   - Phase breakdown from requirements
   - ROADMAP.md update pattern
   - First phase setup

3. Create references/milestone-completion.md:
   - Phase completion verification
   - Archive process (move to milestones/)
   - STATE.md updates
   - Completion summary format
   - Next milestone prompting

4. Create references/milestone-auditing.md:
   - Requirements coverage analysis
   - Gap identification methodology
   - Audit report format
   - Gap remediation options
   - milestone-plan-gaps integration

Extract content from:
- commands/kata/milestone-new.md (has creation workflow)
- commands/kata/milestone-complete.md (has completion workflow)
- commands/kata/milestone-audit.md (has audit workflow)
- agents/kata-roadmapper.md (has roadmap operations)
- kata/workflows/milestone-new.md (has orchestration flow)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - ls skills/kata-manageing-milestones/ shows SKILL.md and references/ directory
    - wc -l skills/kata-manageing-milestones/SKILL.md shows less than 500 lines
    - grep "name: kata-manageing-milestones" skills/kata-manageing-milestones/SKILL.md returns match
    - grep "Task" skills/kata-manageing-milestones/SKILL.md shows sub-agent spawning
    - ls skills/kata-manageing-milestones/references/ shows 3 files
  </verify>
  <done>
    - SKILL.md exists with proper frontmatter (name, description only)
    - SKILL.md under 500 lines with workflow that spawns kata-roadmapper
    - 3 reference files exist with creation, completion, and auditing content
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Skill structure follows /building-claude-code-skills methodology
2. SKILL.md has proper frontmatter (name and description only)
3. SKILL.md under 500 lines with workflow referencing ./references/*.md
4. All 3 reference files contain extracted content from command/workflow files
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- skills/kata-manageing-milestones/SKILL.md exists with orchestrator workflow
- skills/kata-manageing-milestones/references/ contains 3 reference files
- Skill handles new, complete, and audit operations
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/00-convert-commands-to-skills/00-05-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
