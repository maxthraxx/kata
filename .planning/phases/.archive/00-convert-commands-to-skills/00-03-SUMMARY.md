# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 00-01
    provides: Skills architecture pattern from kata-planning-phases
provides:
  - kata-verification skill for work verification
  - Goal-backward verification methodology reference
  - UAT testing protocol reference
  - Debugging workflow reference
affects: [kata-execution, phase-verification]

key-decisions:
  - "Separated goal-backward verification from UAT as distinct modes"
  - "UAT uses conversational plain-text responses (no forms)"
  - "Debugging workflow extracts root causes before fix planning"

patterns-established:
  - "Verification skill spawns kata-verifier for must_haves checking"
  - "Verification skill spawns kata-debugger for issue diagnosis"
  - "Reference files use intention-revealing names"

# Phase 00 Plan 03: kata-verification Skill Summary

**Work verification orchestrator with goal-backward verification, UAT protocol, and debugging workflow integration**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-19T20:59:22Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-19T21:02:27Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files created:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Created kata-verification skill (343 lines) following building-claude-code-skills methodology
- Implemented workflow that spawns kata-verifier and kata-debugger sub-agents via Task tool
- Created 3 reference files covering verification methodology, UAT protocol, and debugging workflow
- Extracted content from existing commands/agents: phase-verify.md, debug.md, kata-verifier.md, kata-debugger.md

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Create kata-verification skill with references** - `941cbd6` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `skills/kata-verification/SKILL.md` - Work verification orchestrator with goal-backward and UAT modes
- `skills/kata-verification/references/goal-backward-verification.md` - must_haves verification methodology
- `skills/kata-verification/references/uat-protocol.md` - User acceptance testing protocol
- `skills/kata-verification/references/debugging-workflow.md` - Issue diagnosis workflow

## Decisions Made

- **Dual verification modes:** Goal-backward (automated) vs UAT (conversational) as distinct entry points
- **Severity inference:** UAT infers severity from natural language rather than asking user
- **Diagnosis before planning:** Debugging workflow runs between gap detection and fix planning

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- kata-verification skill ready for natural language invocation
- Can verify work against must_haves and run conversational UAT
- Integrates with kata-debugger for issue diagnosis
