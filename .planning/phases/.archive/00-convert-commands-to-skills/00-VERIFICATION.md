### Requirements Coverage

No requirements mapped to Phase 0 (infrastructure improvement).

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File   | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact            |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| (none) | -    | -       | -        | No blockers found |

Reference files contain documentation examples of stub patterns (e.g., "grep -E TODO|FIXME") which is appropriate - they teach detection, not actual stubs.

### Human Verification Required

None required. All success criteria verified programmatically.

### Phase Summary

Phase 0 goal fully achieved:

1. **8 Skills Created:** All 8 skills exist with proper structure
   - kata-planning-phases (285 lines)
   - kata-execution (306 lines)
   - kata-verification (343 lines)
   - kata-starting-project-news (355 lines)
   - kata-manageing-milestones (282 lines)
   - kata-managing-project-roadmap (303 lines)
   - kata-researching-phases (372 lines)
   - kata-utility (256 lines)

2. **Proper Frontmatter:** Each SKILL.md has only `name:` and `description:` fields (no other frontmatter)

3. **Progressive Disclosure:** 26 reference files across 8 skills (3-4 per skill)

4. **Orchestrator Pattern:** All skills spawn sub-agents via Task tool (24 Task() calls verified)

5. **Installation Updated:** bin/install.js copies skills/ directory (lines 330-360)

6. **Documentation Updated:** CLAUDE.md "Skills Architecture" section documents purpose, available skills table, and structure pattern
