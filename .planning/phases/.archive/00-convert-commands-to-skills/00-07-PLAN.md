  <action>
Create the kata-researching-phases skill following /building-claude-code-skills methodology:

1. Create skills/kata-researching-phases/SKILL.md:
   - Frontmatter: name (kata-researching-phases), description (trigger-focused, 3rd person)
   - Description includes: "research phase", "investigate", "explore", "discuss phase", "scope discussion", "assumptions", "technical research", "domain research"
   - NO allowed-tools, model, agent, context fields
   - Core workflow (~350 lines max):
     * Determine operation from natural language (research, discuss, assumptions)
     * For RESEARCH phase:
       - Determine discovery level (0-3) based on phase characteristics
       - Spawn kata-phase-researcher for technical investigation
       - Spawn kata-researching-phases-synthesizer to consolidate findings
       - Create RESEARCH.md with standard_stack, architecture_patterns, pitfalls
     * For DISCUSS phase:
       - Interactive conversation about phase scope
       - Ask clarifying questions about user intent
       - Identify essential features vs nice-to-haves
       - Create CONTEXT.md capturing user's vision
     * For LIST ASSUMPTIONS:
       - Analyze phase goal and requirements
       - Identify implicit assumptions
       - Generate assumptions list
       - Offer to verify assumptions with user
   - Reference supporting files with relative paths

2. Create references/discovery-levels.md:
   - Level 0: Skip (pure internal work)
   - Level 1: Quick verification (2-5 min)
   - Level 2: Standard research (15-30 min)
   - Level 3: Deep dive (1+ hour)
   - Depth indicators for each level
   - When to suggest full research phase

3. Create references/research-protocol.md:
   - RESEARCH.md structure
   - Standard stack section
   - Architecture patterns section
   - Don't hand-roll section
   - Common pitfalls section
   - State of the art section
   - Sources classification (primary, secondary, tertiary)

4. Create references/discussion-protocol.md:
   - CONTEXT.md structure
   - Question flow for scope clarification
   - Essential features vs nice-to-haves
   - Capturing user's vision
   - Boundary setting

Extract content from:
- commands/kata/phase-research.md (has research workflow)
- commands/kata/phase-discuss.md (has discussion workflow)
- commands/kata/phase-assumptions.md (has assumptions analysis)
- agents/kata-phase-researcher.md (has research methodology)
- agents/kata-researching-phases-synthesizer.md (has synthesis methodology)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - ls skills/kata-researching-phases/ shows SKILL.md and references/ directory
    - wc -l skills/kata-researching-phases/SKILL.md shows less than 500 lines
    - grep "name: kata-researching-phases" skills/kata-researching-phases/SKILL.md returns match
    - grep "Task" skills/kata-researching-phases/SKILL.md shows sub-agent spawning
    - ls skills/kata-researching-phases/references/ shows 3 files
  </verify>
  <done>
    - SKILL.md exists with proper frontmatter (name, description only)
    - SKILL.md under 500 lines with workflow that spawns kata-phase-researcher, kata-researching-phases-synthesizer
    - 3 reference files exist with discovery levels, research protocol, and discussion protocol
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Skill structure follows /building-claude-code-skills methodology
2. SKILL.md has proper frontmatter (name and description only)
3. SKILL.md under 500 lines with workflow referencing ./references/*.md
4. All 3 reference files contain extracted content from command/agent files
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- skills/kata-researching-phases/SKILL.md exists with orchestrator workflow
- skills/kata-researching-phases/references/ contains 3 reference files
- Skill handles research, discuss, and assumptions operations
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/00-convert-commands-to-skills/00-07-SUMMARY.md`
