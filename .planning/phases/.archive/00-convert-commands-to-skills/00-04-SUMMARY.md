requires:
  - phase: 00-01
    provides: kata-planning-phases skill pattern and structure
provides:
  - kata-starting-project-news skill for new project setup
  - discovery-protocol reference for user interviews
  - project-template reference for PROJECT.md structure
  - roadmap-creation reference for ROADMAP.md structure
affects: [execution, verification, milestone-management]

patterns-established:
  - "Discovery interview pattern: open question, follow threads, checklist as guide not interrogation"
  - "Brownfield detection pattern: check for existing code before project setup"
  - "Goal-backward phase derivation: derive phases from requirements, not templates"

# Phase 00 Plan 04: kata-starting-project-news Skill Summary

**Project initialization orchestrator skill with discovery protocol, project template, and roadmap creation references**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-19T20:59:29Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-19T21:03:05Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files created:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Created kata-starting-project-news skill as full orchestrator (355 lines)
- Extracted discovery interview protocol from kata-project-researcher agent
- Consolidated project template guidance from existing templates
- Documented roadmap creation process with coverage validation

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create kata-starting-project-news skill with references** - `3a1ca59` (feat)

## Files Created

- `skills/kata-starting-project-news/SKILL.md` - Main skill orchestrator handling new project onboarding
- `skills/kata-starting-project-news/references/discovery-protocol.md` - Interview techniques, questioning patterns, context checklist
- `skills/kata-starting-project-news/references/project-template.md` - PROJECT.md structure and section guidelines
- `skills/kata-starting-project-news/references/roadmap-creation.md` - Phase identification, goal-backward criteria, coverage validation

## Decisions Made

- SKILL.md structured as full orchestrator that spawns sub-agents (kata-project-researcher, kata-roadmapper)
- Three reference files cover distinct aspects: discovery, project structure, roadmap creation
- Matched structure and style of kata-planning-phases skill from plan 00-01
- Discovery protocol emphasizes "follow the thread" approach over checklist interrogation

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Skill structure established following kata-planning-phases pattern
- Ready for remaining skills (execution, verification, milestone management)
- Sub-agents (kata-project-researcher, kata-roadmapper) exist and are referenced
