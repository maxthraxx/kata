## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Skills Installation
expected: Running `node bin/install.js --local` copies all 8 skills. After installation, `ls .claude/skills/kata-*` shows 8 directories: kata-planning-phases, kata-execution, kata-verification, kata-starting-project-news, kata-manageing-milestones, kata-managing-project-roadmap, kata-researching-phases, kata-utility
result: pass

### 2. kata-planning-phases Skill Invocation
expected: Saying "help me plan phase 1" or similar triggers kata-planning-phases skill, which appears in Claude's response as skill invocation
result: pass

### 3. kata-execution Skill Invocation
expected: Saying "execute the current phase" or similar triggers kata-execution skill invocation
result: skipped
reason: Pivoting to outcome-based testing with kata-metrics test project

### 4. kata-verification Skill Invocation
expected: Saying "verify the work on phase 0" or similar triggers kata-verification skill invocation
result: skipped
reason: Pivoting to outcome-based testing with kata-metrics test project

### 5. kata-starting-project-news Skill Invocation
expected: Saying "start a new project" or similar triggers kata-starting-project-news skill invocation
result: skipped
reason: Pivoting to outcome-based testing with kata-metrics test project

### 6. kata-manageing-milestones Skill Invocation
expected: Saying "create a new milestone" or "audit the milestone" triggers kata-manageing-milestones skill invocation
result: skipped
reason: Pivoting to outcome-based testing with kata-metrics test project

### 7. kata-managing-project-roadmap Skill Invocation
expected: Saying "add a phase to the roadmap" or "insert an urgent phase" triggers kata-managing-project-roadmap skill invocation
result: skipped
reason: Pivoting to outcome-based testing with kata-metrics test project

### 8. kata-researching-phases Skill Invocation
expected: Saying "research how to implement phase 2" or "discuss the phase approach" triggers kata-researching-phases skill invocation
result: skipped
reason: Pivoting to outcome-based testing with kata-metrics test project

### 9. kata-utility Skill Invocation
expected: Saying "check progress" or "debug this issue" triggers kata-utility skill invocation
result: skipped
reason: Pivoting to outcome-based testing with kata-metrics test project

### 10. CLAUDE.md Skills Documentation
expected: Opening CLAUDE.md shows a "Skills Architecture" section documenting all 8 skills with their purpose and sub-agents table
result: pass

## Outcome Tests (kata-metrics test project)

Tests below exercise skill workflows against ../kata-metrics/ to verify actual outcomes.

### 11. kata-starting-project-news Outcome
expected: Running kata-starting-project-news skill on kata-metrics creates valid PROJECT.md with vision, requirements, and ROADMAP.md with phases
result: pass
notes: "Worked perfectly with natural language - validates skills-first approach"

### 12. kata-planning-phases Outcome
expected: Running kata-planning-phases skill produces valid PLAN.md files with tasks, waves, and verification steps
result: pass
notes: "3 plans with proper frontmatter, waves, must_haves, verification - high quality"

### 13. kata-execution Outcome
expected: Running kata-execution skill executes plans, creates SUMMARY.md files, makes atomic commits
result: pass
notes: "Re-test 2026-01-19: 'execute the phase' triggered skill, spawned kata-executor sub-agents in waves, executed 4 plans with commits. Phase 2 complete with verification."
severity: resolved

### 14. kata-verification Outcome
expected: Running kata-verification skill validates built features, creates UAT.md, diagnoses issues
result: pass
notes: "Re-test 2026-01-19: Skill renamed to kata-verification-and-uat. 'run uat', 'uat phase 2', 'acceptance test' now all trigger correctly. Key learning: skill name and description are critical for autonomous invocation."
severity: resolved

### 15. kata-manageing-milestones Outcome
expected: Running kata-manageing-milestones skill creates/audits/archives milestones correctly
result: pass
notes: "Comprehensive audit with requirements coverage (9/44), phase tracking (1/4), found tech debt issues, created v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md"

### 16. kata-managing-project-roadmap Outcome
expected: Running kata-managing-project-roadmap skill adds/inserts/removes phases with correct numbering
result: pass
notes: "Re-test 2026-01-19: 'add a phase for caching' triggered skill automatically. Created Phase 6 with proper success criteria. Gap closure fix worked."
severity: resolved

### 17. kata-researching-phases Outcome
expected: Running kata-researching-phases skill produces RESEARCH.md with domain analysis and approach options
result: pass
notes: "Skill triggered, spawned kata-phase-researcher (32 tools, 5m), created 622-line RESEARCH.md with deps, patterns, recommendations"

### 18. kata-utility Outcome
expected: Running kata-utility skill shows progress, debugs issues, maps codebase correctly
result: pass
notes: "Re-test 2026-01-19: Required renaming skill to 'kata-progress-and-status-utilities' and updating description. After changes, 'give me a progress update' triggered skill automatically."
severity: resolved-with-changes

| 14   | issue    | pass    | "run kata uat" triggers UAT mode (kata prefix required) |
| 16   | issue    | pass    | "add a phase" triggered skill automatically             |
| 18   | issue    | pass    | Required skill rename to work                           |

## Gaps

- truth: "Next Up sections should guide users to skills, not just slash commands"
  status: improvement
  reason: "User noted: Next Up instructions reference /kata:command format but skills-first approach needs natural language alternatives or skill invocation syntax"
  severity: minor

  status: resolved
  reason: "Re-test 2026-01-19: Gap closure 00-10 added explicit instructions. Skill now invokes correctly with sub-agents."

- truth: "kata-verification creates UAT.md and presents interactive tests"
  status: resolved
  reason: "Skill renamed to kata-verification-and-uat. Including 'uat' in skill name ensures it matches before Claude defaults to running test suite."

  working_prompts: ["run uat", "uat phase 2", "acceptance test"]
