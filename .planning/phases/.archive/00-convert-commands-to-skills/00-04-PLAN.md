Create the kata-starting-project-news skill following /building-claude-code-skills methodology:

1. Create skills/kata-starting-project-news/SKILL.md:
   - Frontmatter: name (kata-starting-project-news), description (trigger-focused, 3rd person)
   - Description includes: "new project", "start project", "initialize kata", "setup project", "create project", "onboard"
   - NO allowed-tools, model, agent, context fields
   - Core workflow (~350 lines max):
     * Check if .planning/ already exists (offer to resume or reset)
     * Spawn kata-project-researcher for discovery interview:
       - What are you building?
       - Who is it for?
       - What makes it valuable?
       - What constraints exist?
       - What's your first milestone?
     * Create .planning/ directory structure
     * Create PROJECT.md from discovery
     * Create REQUIREMENTS.md
     * Spawn kata-roadmapper to create ROADMAP.md with first milestone
     * Create STATE.md
     * Offer to start first phase planning
   - Reference supporting files with relative paths

2. Create references/discovery-protocol.md:
   - Discovery interview questions
   - Follow-up question patterns
   - Information synthesis
   - When to stop asking questions
   - Solo developer + Claude context (no enterprise patterns)

3. Create references/project-template.md:
   - PROJECT.md structure (Metadata, Vision, Users, Core Value, Scope, etc.)
   - Required vs optional sections
   - Example PROJECT.md
   - Anti-patterns to avoid

4. Create references/roadmap-creation.md:
   - ROADMAP.md structure
   - Milestone definition
   - Phase breakdown from requirements
   - Dependency ordering
   - Success criteria format

Extract content from:
- agents/kata-project-researcher.md (has discovery protocol)
- agents/kata-roadmapper.md (has roadmap creation logic)
- kata/workflows/project-new.md (has orchestration flow)
- kata/templates/project.md (has project template)
- kata/templates/requirements.md (has requirements template)
- kata/templates/roadmap.md (has roadmap template)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - ls skills/kata-starting-project-news/ shows SKILL.md and references/ directory
    - wc -l skills/kata-starting-project-news/SKILL.md shows less than 500 lines
    - grep "name: kata-starting-project-news" skills/kata-starting-project-news/SKILL.md returns match
    - grep "Task" skills/kata-starting-project-news/SKILL.md shows sub-agent spawning
    - ls skills/kata-starting-project-news/references/ shows 3 files
  </verify>
  <done>
    - SKILL.md exists with proper frontmatter (name, description only)
    - SKILL.md under 500 lines with workflow that spawns kata-project-researcher, kata-roadmapper
    - 3 reference files exist with discovery, project template, and roadmap content
  </done>
</task>

1. Skill structure follows /building-claude-code-skills methodology
2. SKILL.md has proper frontmatter (name and description only)
3. SKILL.md under 500 lines with workflow referencing ./references/*.md
4. All 3 reference files contain extracted content from agent/workflow/template files
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- skills/kata-starting-project-news/SKILL.md exists with orchestrator workflow
- skills/kata-starting-project-news/references/ contains 3 reference files
- Skill can spawn kata-project-researcher and kata-roadmapper via Task tool
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/00-convert-commands-to-skills/00-04-SUMMARY.md`
