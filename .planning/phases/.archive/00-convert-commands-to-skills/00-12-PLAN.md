<objective>
Improve skill trigger phrases for better autonomous invocation.

Purpose: UAT found that kata-managing-project-roadmap and kata-utility skills don't auto-trigger for common user requests. The skill descriptions need better trigger phrases that match natural language patterns.

Output: Updated SKILL.md files with improved description fields containing better trigger phrases.

2. kata-utility trigger gap:

  status: failed

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Improve kata-managing-project-roadmap triggers</name>
  <files>skills/kata-managing-project-roadmap/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Update the description field in frontmatter to include more natural language trigger phrases.

Current description starts with:
"Use this skill when adding phases to the roadmap..."

Update to include these additional trigger phrases:
- "add a phase" (exact common phrase)
- "add phase to the roadmap"
- "new phase for"
- "create a phase"
- "I need a new phase"
- "add X as a phase"
- "let's add a phase"

New description (combine existing with new triggers):
```yaml
description: Use this skill when adding phases to the roadmap, inserting urgent phases between existing phases, removing future phases, planning gap closure phases, or managing the project roadmap structure. Triggers include "add a phase", "add phase to roadmap", "new phase", "create a phase", "I need a phase", "insert phase", "urgent phase", "remove phase", "plan gaps", "fill gaps", "coverage gaps", "roadmap management", and "decimal phase numbering". This skill handles all roadmap modifications.
```

Also update the "When to Use" section to include:
- User says "add a phase" or "I need a new phase"
- User says "let's add X to the roadmap"
  </action>
  <verify>grep -E "add a phase|new phase|create a phase" skills/kata-managing-project-roadmap/SKILL.md returns matches in description</verify>
  <done>Skill description includes natural "add a phase" trigger phrases</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Improve kata-utility triggers</name>
  <files>skills/kata-utility/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Update the description field in frontmatter to include status-related trigger phrases.

Current description starts with:
"Use this skill for project utility operations including progress checks..."

Update to include these additional trigger phrases:
- "check status"
- "what's the status"
- "current status"
- "show status"
- "project status"
- "how are we doing"
- "how's the project"
- "what's happening"

New description (combine existing with new triggers):
```yaml
description: Use this skill for project utility operations including progress checks, status reports, debugging, session management, and codebase mapping. Triggers include "progress", "status", "check status", "what's the status", "current status", "show status", "project status", "how are we doing", "where am I", "what's next", "debug", "diagnose", "fix issue", "pause work", "take a break", "resume work", "continue", "map codebase", and "analyze code structure". This skill spawns kata-debugger and kata-codebase-mapper sub-agents.
```

Also update the Operation Detection table to include:
| "check status", "what's the status", "how are we doing" | PROGRESS |
  </action>
  <verify>grep -E "check status|current status|what's the status" skills/kata-utility/SKILL.md returns matches</verify>
  <done>Skill description includes status-related trigger phrases</done>

<success_criteria>
Skills now trigger correctly for:
1. "add a phase" -> kata-managing-project-roadmap
2. "I need a new phase for X" -> kata-managing-project-roadmap
3. "check status" -> kata-utility
4. "what's the current status" -> kata-utility
</success_criteria>
