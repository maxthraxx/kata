**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| #   | Truth                                                       | Status     | Evidence                                                                  |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Developer can look up branch naming convention              | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 110-127: Pattern `{type}/v{milestone}-{phase}-{slug}` with examples |
| 2   | Developer understands PR-per-phase workflow timing          | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 128-154 (lifecycle), 168-177 (timing table)                         |
| 3   | Developer knows release = milestone relationship            | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 155-167: "Release = milestone (1:1 mapping)" documented             |
| 4   | Developer sees which commands change with pr_workflow: true | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 179-189: Integration points table with 5 commands                   |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact                             | Expected                           | Status     | Details                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `kata/references/planning-config.md` | Complete pr_workflow documentation | ✓ VERIFIED | 266 lines, no stubs, comprehensive content |

**Artifact Quality:**
- Level 1 (Exists): PASSED — File exists at expected path
- Level 2 (Substantive): PASSED — 266 lines, no TODO/FIXME/placeholders, includes examples and tables
- Level 3 (Wired): PARTIAL — Reference material not yet integrated into workflows (expected for documentation phase)

### Key Link Verification

| From               | To             | Via                     | Status       | Details                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| planning-config.md | kata workflows | command behavior tables | ⚠️ DOCUMENTED | Table at lines 179-189 documents which commands will check pr_workflow, but implementation deferred to future phases |

**Note:** Documentation phase creates reference material. Workflow integration expected in Phase 2 (Marketplace Distribution) or Phase 3 (Documentation) when implementing the documented behaviors.

### Requirements Coverage

Phase 1.1 is an INSERTED phase with no mapped requirements (urgent insertion for product clarity).

**Success Criteria from ROADMAP.md:**

| 5. Workflow timing documented                                 | ✓ SATISFIED | Lines 168-177: Table with 5 workflow steps          |

### Anti-Patterns Found

None detected.

**Scanned files:**
- `kata/references/planning-config.md` (lines 91-202)

**Checks performed:**
- TODO/FIXME comments: 0 found
- Placeholder content: 0 found
- Empty implementations: 0 found (N/A for documentation)
- Console.log only: 0 found (N/A for documentation)

### Human Verification Required

None. All success criteria are verifiable programmatically:
- Branch naming pattern is documented with examples
- PR workflow stages are documented in order
- Release-milestone relationship is explicitly stated
- Workflow timing table exists with all steps
- Integration points table lists affected commands

---

## Verification Details

### Branch Naming Convention

**Pattern documented:** `{type}/v{milestone}-{phase}-{slug}`

**Examples provided:**
- `feat/v0.1.9-01-plugin-structure-validation`
- `fix/v0.1.9-01.1-document-pr-workflow`
- `docs/v0.2.0-03-api-reference`

**Prefix types documented:** feat, fix, docs, refactor, chore

**Timing documented:** "Create after planning complete, before execution"

### PR Granularity & Lifecycle

**Granularity:** "One PR per phase (not per-plan, not per-milestone)"

**Lifecycle stages:**
1. Create branch (after planning, before execution)
2. Open draft PR (at first commit)
3. Mark ready (all plans complete)
4. Merge (after approval)

**PR formats documented:**
- Title: `v{milestone} Phase {N}: {Phase Name}`
- Body: Includes phase goal, plan checklist, test criteria

### Release-Milestone Relationship

**Core rule:** "Release = milestone — Only one release per milestone (1:1 mapping)"

**Key details:**
- Milestone name IS the version (v0.1.9 milestone → v0.1.9 release)
- No mid-milestone releases
- Release trigger: Merge to main with version bump
- Version bump timing: Before `/kata:milestone-complete`

### Workflow Timing

**Table provided with 5 steps:**
| Step          | When                             | What Happens                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Create branch | After planning, before execution | git checkout command               |
| Open PR       | At first commit                  | Draft with title/body              |
| Execute plans | During phase                     | Commits to branch                  |
| Mark ready    | All plans complete               | Convert to ready                   |
| Merge         | After approval                   | Triggers release if version bumped |

### Integration Points

**Table provided with 5 commands:**
| Command            | pr_workflow: false | pr_workflow: true                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| project-new        | Asks about config  | Offers GitHub Actions scaffold     |
| settings           | Allows toggle      | Same                               |
| phase-execute      | Commits to main    | Create branch, open draft PR       |
| milestone-complete | Creates local tag  | Skips tag, defer to GitHub Release |
| progress           | Phase status only  | Show PR status                     |

**Bash example provided:** Shows how to check pr_workflow config and branch behavior in `kata-completing-milestones`

## Summary

**Phase goal achieved:** Complete documentation of pr_workflow config behavior.

**What was verified:**
1. All 5 success criteria from ROADMAP.md are satisfied
2. All 4 observable truths are achievable via the documentation
3. Documentation is substantive (266 lines, no placeholders)
4. Examples and tables are concrete and usable

**What's deferred:**
- Workflow integration (expected in future phases)
- Implementation of documented behaviors in commands

**Next phase readiness:** Documentation is complete and ready for implementation phases to reference. Integration points table clearly identifies which commands need pr_workflow behavior added.
