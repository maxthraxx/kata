# Phase 01.1 Plan 01: Document PR Workflow Behavior Summary

**Complete pr_workflow config documentation: branch naming convention, PR-per-phase lifecycle, release=milestone relationship, workflow timing, and command integration points**

## Performance

- Documented PR-per-phase workflow with lifecycle stages (draft -> ready -> merge)
- Documented release = milestone relationship (1:1 mapping)
- Added workflow timing table showing when to branch, PR, mark ready, merge
- Added integration points table showing command behavior changes with pr_workflow: true

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:
