# Phase 01.3 Plan 01: Discuss Phase Skill Summary

**Created kata-discussing-phase-context skill with domain-aware gray area identification and 4-question deep-dive pattern for capturing pre-planning user decisions**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T22:50:52Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T22:53:40Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Created SKILL.md with complete 8-step discuss workflow (279 lines, well under 500 limit)
- Established domain-aware gray area identification (SEE/CALL/RUN/READ/ORGANIZE categories)
- Created comprehensive discussion-protocol.md with philosophy, scope guardrail, and question design
- Created context-template.md with XML semantic structure and complete example

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create SKILL.md with discuss workflow** - `2aa53e4` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create references/ subdirectory with protocol and template** - `9e3849e` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `skills/kata-discussing-phase-context/SKILL.md` - Main skill orchestrator (279 lines)
- `skills/kata-discussing-phase-context/references/discussion-protocol.md` - Gray area identification and questioning guidelines
- `skills/kata-discussing-phase-context/references/context-template.md` - CONTEXT.md output structure with example

## Decisions Made

- **Exhaustive triggers:** 14 trigger phrases in description for reliable autonomous invocation
- **No skip option:** When presenting gray areas, user must select at least one - they invoked to discuss
- **4-question rhythm:** Deep-dive each area with 4 questions, then check if more needed

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Skill ready for installation via `node bin/install.js --local`
- Plan 02 can add test file for the skill
- Research and planning skills can now consume CONTEXT.md from discussions
