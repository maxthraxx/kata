# Phase v0.1.9-01 Plan 01: Plugin Structure & Validation Summary

**Claude Code plugin manifest and hooks configuration with validated structure**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T14:58:16Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T14:59:37Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with all required metadata (name, version, description, author, homepage, repository, license, keywords)
- Created `hooks/hooks.json` registering kata-check-update.js for SessionStart
- Validated plugin structure with `claude plugin validate .` - passed
- Verified all 27 /kata:* commands accessible via `--plugin-dir ./`

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create plugin manifest** - `2cd4320` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create hooks.json** - `5017bed` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Validate plugin structure** - no commit (validation only, no files changed)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin manifest with metadata (name: kata, version: 0.1.6)
- `hooks/hooks.json` - Hook configuration registering SessionStart handler

## Decisions Made

- **Statusline excluded from hooks.json** - Per research, statusline is user preference not plugin functionality. Including it would overwrite user configurations.
- **Plugin version 0.1.6** - Matches milestone version per plan instructions, not package.json (0.1.7)
- **Only SessionStart hook registered** - kata-check-update.js is the only hook needed for plugin functionality; statusline is user-configurable separately

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plugin manifest and hooks configuration complete
- Ready for Phase 2 (distribution/publishing) - marketplace repository setup
- Plugin validates and loads correctly with all 27 commands
