## Phase Details

### v0.1.5 Skills & Documentation

#### Phase 0: Convert Commands to Skills
**Goal**: Create 8 skills as orchestrators following /building-claude-code-skills methodology
**Strategy** (REVISED 2026-01-19):
- Skills only — Create skills containing full workflow logic
- Leave commands unchanged — Keep for A/B testing between old commands and new skills
- No agent-skill binding — Skills ARE orchestrators that spawn multiple sub-agents via Task tool
- Use /building-claude-code-skills methodology — Follow the official skill-building patterns
**Depends on**: Nothing
**Requirements**: None (infrastructure improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. 8 skills created: kata-planning-phases, kata-execution, kata-verification, kata-starting-new-projects, kata-manageing-milestones, kata-managing-project-roadmap, kata-researching-phases, kata-utility
  2. Each skill has SKILL.md (<500 lines) with proper frontmatter (name, description only)
  3. Each skill has references/ subdirectory for progressive disclosure
  4. Skills spawn sub-agents via Task tool (skills ARE orchestrators)
  5. Installation script updated to copy skills/ directory
  6. CLAUDE.md updated to document skills architecture
**Plans**: 12 plans (9 original + 3 gap closure)

Plans:
- [x] 00-01-PLAN.md — Create kata-planning-phases skill + update installer
- [x] 00-02-PLAN.md — Create kata-execution skill
- [x] 00-03-PLAN.md — Create kata-verification skill
- [x] 00-04-PLAN.md — Create kata-starting-new-projects skill
- [x] 00-05-PLAN.md — Create kata-manageing-milestones skill
- [x] 00-06-PLAN.md — Create kata-managing-project-roadmap skill
- [x] 00-07-PLAN.md — Create kata-researching-phases skill
- [x] 00-08-PLAN.md — Create kata-utility skill
- [x] 00-09-PLAN.md — Update CLAUDE.md documentation + test installation
- [x] 00-10-PLAN.md — Fix kata-execution SUMMARY/commits (gap closure)
- [x] 00-11-PLAN.md — Fix kata-verification UAT workflow (gap closure)
- [x] 00-12-PLAN.md — Improve skill trigger phrases (gap closure)

#### Phase 1: Migrate Todo Commands to Kata Skill
**Goal**: Create `kata-managing-todos` skill to handle todo capture and management, migrating functionality from GSD's `add-todo` and `check-todos` commands
**Depends on**: Phase 0 (Skills established)
**Requirements**: None (skill migration)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. kata-managing-todos skill created with SKILL.md (<500 lines)
  2. Skill has references/ subdirectory (todo-format.md, actions.md)
  3. ADD operation captures todos with area inference and duplicate detection
  4. CHECK operation lists pending todos with action options (work on, add to phase, create phase, brainstorm, put back)
  5. STATE.md updated on todo add/complete
  6. Installation verified with natural language triggers
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Create SKILL.md with operation detection and ADD operation
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Add CHECK operation and references/actions.md
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Verify installation and natural language triggers (renamed to kata-managing-todos)

#### Phase 1.1: Testing & Evals Harness (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Create a CLI-based testing framework that leverages Claude Code's command-line instantiation (`claude "prompt"`) to programmatically test Kata skills and commands
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (Todo skill exists for test subject)
**Requirements**: None (infrastructure improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Test harness script(s) can invoke `claude "prompt"` with controlled inputs
  2. Outcome parser scripts verify: skill invoked? correct artifacts produced?
  3. At least one skill covered by automated test (proof of concept)
  4. Tests can run in CI-like environment (no interactive prompts)
  5. Clear pass/fail reporting for UAT efficiency
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 01.1-01: TBD (run /kata-planning-phases to break down)

#### Phase 2: Create Kata Slash Commands
**Goal**: Create GSD-equivalent slash commands that instantiate corresponding Kata skills, ensuring explicit invocation path alongside autonomous skill triggering
**Depends on**: Phase 0 (Skills exist), Phase 1.1 (Testing harness exists for verification)
**Requirements**: None (usability improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Kata slash commands created for all GSD command equivalents (25 commands)
  2. Each command has `disable-model-invocation: true` in frontmatter
  3. Each corresponding Kata skill has `user-invocable: false` in frontmatter
  4. Commands delegate to skills (thin wrappers that instantiate skill workflows)
  5. Gap skills created for any GSD commands without Kata skill equivalents
  6. NextUp tables updated to show `/kata-{command}` explicit invocation format
  7. README documentation updated with command reference
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: TBD (run /kata-planning-phases to break down)

#### Phase 3: Documentation
**Goal**: Complete README documentation and add onboarding guidance to help new users understand how Kata works
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (Slash commands complete)
**Requirements**: None (documentation improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. README.md sections completed (no trailing incomplete text)
  2. "What is This" section clearly explains Kata's differentiation from GSD
  3. Onboarding flow includes explanation of how the Kata system works
  4. New users can understand skills vs commands, planning workflow, and execution model
**Plans**: TBD
