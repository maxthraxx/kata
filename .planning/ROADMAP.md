# Roadmap: Kata v0.1.5 GitHub Integration

## Overview

v0.1.5 adds optional, modular GitHub integration to Kata. The integration syncs Kata milestones, phases, and plans with GitHub Milestones, Issues, and PRs. All GitHub features are config-driven and can be enabled/disabled without affecting core Kata workflows.

## Milestones

- **v0.1.4 Hard Fork & Rebrand** — Phase 0 (shipped 2026-01-18) — [archive](milestones/v0.1.4-ROADMAP.md)
- **v0.1.5 GitHub Integration** — Phases 0-5 (in progress)

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

### v0.1.5 GitHub Integration (In Progress)

- [ ] **Phase 0: Convert Commands to Skills** (INSERTED) - Use skill-builder to convert Kata commands to Skills format
- [ ] **Phase 0.1: Claude Code Plugin Distribution** (INSERTED) - Create plugin distribution using `/plugin-dev:create-plugin`
- [ ] **Phase 1: Audit & Config Foundation** - Understand integration points, establish config schema
- [ ] **Phase 2: Onboarding & Milestones** - Config during new-project, GitHub Milestone creation
- [ ] **Phase 3: Phase Issues** - Create GitHub Issues for phases with labels and metadata
- [ ] **Phase 4: Plan Sync** - Checklist items in issues, update as plans complete
- [ ] **Phase 5: PR Integration** - Create PRs at phase completion with auto-linking

## Phase Details

### Phase 0: Convert Commands to Skills (INSERTED)
**Goal**: 
- Convert Kata slash commands to Claude Code Skills format using `/skill-builder`
- Retain existing slash command files, but have them point to the new Skills, allowing for 
  - deterministic execution in addition to autonomous agent skill invokation
  - continue use of $AGRUMENTS (not supported by the SKILLs standard)
**Depends on**: Nothing (prerequisite for GitHub Integration)
**Requirements**: None (infrastructure improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Kata slash commands converted to Skills using skill-builder workflow
  2. Existing slash commands invoke corresponding Skills
  3. Resource files go with skills for adaptive discolosure
  4. skills referce correspoding agent, model and context strategy using front-matter: agent, context, model
  5. Skills provide same functionality as original commands
  6. Commands directory structure updated to Skills format
  7. Installation and usage patterns documented
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 00-01: TBD (run /kata:plan-phase 0 to break down)

### Phase 0.1: Claude Code Plugin Distribution (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Package Kata as a Claude Code plugin for easy distribution using `/plugin-dev:create-plugin`
**Depends on**: Phase 0 (Skills format established)
**Requirements**: None (distribution improvement)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Kata packaged as Claude Code plugin using plugin-dev workflow
  2. Plugin manifest (plugin.json) correctly configured
  3. All commands, agents, workflows available through plugin
  4. Installation via plugin system documented
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 00.1-01: TBD (run /kata:plan-phase 0.1 to break down)

### Phase 1: Audit & Config Foundation
**Goal**: Understand where GitHub integration hooks into existing Kata workflows and establish config schema
**Depends on**: Phase 0 (Skills format established)
**Requirements**: WFA-01, CFG-01, CFG-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Integration points documented for new-milestone, execute-phase, execute-plan commands
  2. `.planning/config.json` includes `github.enabled` boolean toggle
  3. `.planning/config.json` includes `github.issueMode` with values `auto | ask | never`
  4. Kata commands read config and branch on `github.enabled`
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: TBD
- [ ] 01-02: TBD

### Phase 2: Onboarding & Milestones
**Goal**: New projects can configure GitHub integration and milestones create corresponding GitHub Milestones
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (config schema exists)
**Requirements**: CFG-03, GHM-01, GHM-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `/kata:new-project` prompts for GitHub integration preferences
  2. Config choices saved to `.planning/config.json` during onboarding
  3. `/kata:new-milestone` creates GitHub Milestone when `github.enabled = true`
  4. GitHub Milestone includes version number and description from ROADMAP.md
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: TBD
- [ ] 02-02: TBD

### Phase 3: Phase Issues
**Goal**: Phases become GitHub Issues with proper labels, metadata, and milestone assignment
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (milestones exist to assign issues to)
**Requirements**: GHI-01, GHI-02, GHI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Phase issues created with `phase` label when milestone created
  2. Issue body includes phase goal and success criteria from ROADMAP.md
  3. Phase issues assigned to corresponding GitHub Milestone
  4. Issues created respecting `github.issueMode` config setting
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: TBD
- [ ] 03-02: TBD

### Phase 4: Plan Sync
**Goal**: Phase issues track plan progress as checklist items that update during execution
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (phase issues exist)
**Requirements**: GHI-04, GHI-05, WFA-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Phase issue body includes checklist of plans (after `/kata:plan-phase`)
  2. Checklist items checked as each plan completes during `/kata:execute-phase`
  3. Execute-plan workflow conditionally updates GitHub issue
  4. Plan status visible in GitHub without opening Kata
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
