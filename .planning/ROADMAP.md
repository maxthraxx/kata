### v1.0.9 Command Consolidation (Complete)

- [x] **Phase 2.2: Normalize on Skills** (INSERTED) - Remove commands layer, skills become both slash commands and natural language — completed 2026-01-25

#### Phase 2.2: Normalize on Skills (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Eliminate command->skill indirection by making skills directly invocable; update build to strip `kata-` prefix for plugin namespace
**Depends on**: v1.0.8 complete (skills self-contained)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `commands/kata/` directory deleted (27 files)
  2. All skills have `user-invocable: true` (default, remove `user-invocable: false` where present)
  3. Skills invocable as `/kata-planning-phases` (npx) or `/kata:planning-phases` (plugin)
  4. `build.js` strips `kata-` prefix from skill directories and `name` field for plugin distribution
  5. README updated with new invocation syntax
  6. CLAUDE.md updated to reflect architecture change
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02.2-01-PLAN.md — Make all skills user-invocable
- [x] 02.2-02-PLAN.md — Update build.js to strip kata- prefix for plugin
- [x] 02.2-03-PLAN.md — Delete commands, update documentation

<details>

- [x] Phase 7: Deprecate NPX Support (6/6 plans) — completed 2026-01-27

</details>

### v1.3.0 Release Automation (In Progress)

**Goal:** Harden CI validation and automate the release pipeline.

**Phases:** 2 (0-1)
**Requirements:** 4 (REL-01 to REL-04)
**Depth:** Quick

- [x] **Phase 0: Foundation & CI Hardening** — Prevent path resolution issues, validate artifacts before release — completed 2026-01-28
- [x] **Phase 1: Release Automation** — Milestone completion triggers GitHub Release and CI publish — completed 2026-01-28

---

#### Phase 0: Foundation & CI Hardening

**Goal:** CI validates actual plugin artifacts to prevent path resolution failures

**Depends on:** None (foundation)

**Requirements:** None (infrastructure only, prevents repeating v1.0.3-1.0.8 issues)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. CI tests actual plugin artifacts from `dist/plugin/` directory, not just source code
2. Integration test suite validates transformed paths (subagent_type kata: prefix, no @~/.claude/ patterns)
3. Artifact verification script runs in CI before creating GitHub Release
4. Test coverage includes @./references/ path resolution
5. Build failures block release creation (no silent path errors in production)

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 00-01-PLAN.md — Create artifact validation test suite
- [x] 00-02-PLAN.md — Reorder CI workflow for pre-release validation

---

#### Phase 1: Release Automation

**Goal:** Users can trigger release workflow from milestone completion (milestone → PR merge → GitHub Release → CI publish)

**Depends on:** Phase 0 complete

**Requirements:** REL-01, REL-02, REL-03, REL-04

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can auto-generate changelog entries from conventional commits when completing milestone (REL-01)
2. User can auto-detect semantic version bump (major/minor/patch) based on commit types (REL-02)
3. User can trigger release workflow from milestone completion flow (REL-03)
4. User can dry-run release to validate workflow without publishing (REL-04)
5. Version bump script updates `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version field
6. Changelog generation preserves manual curation quality (review gate before publish)

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Create version detection and changelog generation references
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Integrate release workflow into completing-milestones skill
