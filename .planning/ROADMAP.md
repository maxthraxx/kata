# Roadmap: Kata

## Overview

Kata is an independent meta-prompting and context engineering system for Claude Code. The roadmap begins with establishing the independent project identity, then builds complete GitHub Integration (tested in Claude Code), and finally creates a VS Code Adapter for broader adoption.

**Terminology:**
- **Adapter** — Code that makes Kata run in a specific IDE (Claude Code adapter, VS Code adapter)
- **Integration** — Code that connects Kata to an external system (GitHub integration, Linear integration)
- **"Kata for VS Code"** — User-facing name for VS Code adapter

## Milestones

- **v0.1.4 Hard Fork & Rebrand** — Phase 0 (shipped 2026-01-18) — [archive](milestones/v0.1.4-ROADMAP.md)
- **v1.0 GitHub Integration** — Phases 01-6 (in progress)

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (0, 1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

## Phase Details

### Phase 01: Antigravity Adapter (INSERTED)
**Goal:** [Urgent work - to be planned]
**Depends on:** Phase 0
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /kata:plan-phase 01 to break down)

**Details:**
[To be added during planning]

### Phase 1: GitHub Issues Core
**Goal**: Kata milestones and phases sync bidirectionally with GitHub Issues
**Depends on**: Phase 01 (Antigravity Adapter)
**Requirements**: GHISS-01, GHISS-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Creating a milestone/phase in Kata creates corresponding GitHub issues
  2. Updating a GitHub issue reflects in Kata state
  3. Issue status transitions (New, In Progress, In Review, Done) are tracked
  4. Closing an issue in GitHub marks the phase complete in Kata
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: TBD
- [ ] 01-02: TBD
- [ ] 01-03: TBD

### Phase 2: GitHub Issues Polish
**Goal**: Issues are automatically labeled and templates standardize creation
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: GHISS-03, GHISS-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. New issues automatically receive type labels (bug, feature, task)
  2. Priority and size labels are applied based on requirements metadata
  3. Bug report template captures reproduction steps, expected/actual behavior
  4. Feature request template captures user story, acceptance criteria
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: TBD
- [ ] 02-02: TBD

### Phase 3: GitHub PR Creation
**Goal**: Execute-phase automatically creates well-formed PRs with conventions enforced
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (PRs link to issues)
**Requirements**: GHPR-01, GHPR-02, GHPR-03, GHPR-04, GHPR-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Completing execute-phase automatically creates a PR
  2. Branch names follow conventions (feature/, fix/, doc/, chore/, refactor/)
  3. Commits use conventional format (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
  4. Draft PRs can be created for early feedback
  5. PR descriptions include linked issues, change summary, and testing steps
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: TBD
- [ ] 03-02: TBD
- [ ] 03-03: TBD

### Phase 4: GitHub PR Collaboration
**Goal**: Claude conducts PR reviews and responds to team feedback
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: GHPR-06, GHPR-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Claude posts review comments directly to GitHub PR
  2. Reviews consider full Kata context (requirements, plans), not just diff
  3. Claude reads new comments on PRs it created or reviewed
  4. Claude can address team feedback by pushing fixes or responding
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: TBD
- [ ] 04-02: TBD

### Phase 5: GitHub CI/CD
**Goal**: CI checks are orchestrated and changelogs are auto-generated
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (PR workflow complete)
**Requirements**: GHCI-01, GHCI-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Kata waits for CI checks (lint, build, test) to pass before merge
  2. CI failures are surfaced with actionable information
  3. Changelog is auto-generated from merged PRs
  4. Changelog entries include PR title, linked issues, and contributor
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01: TBD
- [ ] 05-02: TBD

### Phase 6: VS Code Adapter
**Goal**: Kata for VS Code — full workflow with GitHub Integration
**Depends on**: Phases 0-5 (complete GitHub Integration to port)
**Requirements**: VSCODE-01, VSCODE-02, VSCODE-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All Kata slash commands work in VS Code (new-project, plan-phase, execute-phase, etc.)
  2. Extension installs from VS Code marketplace or VSIX
  3. Team member can install and configure in under 5 minutes
  4. GitHub Integration works identically to Claude Code version
  5. No bash workarounds required for core workflow
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01: TBD
- [ ] 06-02: TBD
- [ ] 06-03: TBD
