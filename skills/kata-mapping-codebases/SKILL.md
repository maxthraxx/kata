description: Use this skill when analyzing an existing codebase with parallel mapper agents, creating codebase documentation, understanding brownfield projects, or mapping code structure. Triggers include "map codebase", "analyze codebase", "document codebase", "understand code", and "codebase map".

<kata_path>
**IMPORTANT:** Before reading any Kata file (templates, references, workflows), resolve the base path:

```bash
KATA_BASE=$(if [ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then echo "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/kata"; elif [ -d ~/.claude/kata ]; then echo ~/.claude/kata; else echo ./.claude/kata; fi) && echo $KATA_BASE
```

Use the output as `$KATA_BASE` for all file paths below. For example:
- `$KATA_BASE/templates/summary.md` instead of `~/.claude/kata/templates/summary.md`
</kata_path>

<objective>
Analyze existing codebase using parallel kata-codebase-mapper agents to produce structured codebase documents.

Each mapper agent explores a focus area and **writes documents directly** to `.planning/codebase/`. The orchestrator only receives confirmations, keeping context usage minimal.

Output: .planning/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@$KATA_BASE/workflows/project-analyze.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Focus area: $ARGUMENTS (optional - if provided, tells agents to focus on specific subsystem)

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for .planning/STATE.md - loads context if project already initialized

**This command can run:**
- Before /kata:project-new (brownfield codebases) - creates codebase map first
- After /kata:project-new (greenfield codebases) - updates codebase map as code evolves
- Anytime to refresh codebase understanding
</context>

<when_to_use>
**Use project-analyze for:**
- Brownfield projects before initialization (understand existing code first)
- Refreshing codebase map after significant changes
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase
- Before major refactoring (understand current state)
- When STATE.md references outdated codebase info

**Skip project-analyze for:**
- Greenfield projects with no code yet (nothing to map)
- Trivial codebases (<5 files)
</when_to_use>

<process>
1. Check if .planning/codebase/ already exists (offer to refresh or skip)
2. Create .planning/codebase/ directory structure
3. Spawn 4 parallel kata-codebase-mapper agents:
   - Agent 1: tech focus → writes STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
   - Agent 2: arch focus → writes ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
   - Agent 3: quality focus → writes CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
   - Agent 4: concerns focus → writes CONCERNS.md
4. Wait for agents to complete, collect confirmations (NOT document contents)
5. Verify all 7 documents exist with line counts
6. Commit codebase map
7. Offer next steps (typically: /kata:project-new or /kata:phase-plan)
</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] .planning/codebase/ directory created
- [ ] All 7 codebase documents written by mapper agents
- [ ] Documents follow template structure
- [ ] Parallel agents completed without errors
- [ ] User knows next steps
</success_criteria>
