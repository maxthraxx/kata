# Roadmap Management Orchestrator

Manages project roadmap operations: adding phases, inserting urgent phases (decimal numbering), removing phases, and planning gap closure phases.

## When to Use

- User says "add a phase" or "I need a new phase"
- User says "let's add X to the roadmap"
- User asks to "add phase N" or "create a phase"
- User needs to "insert urgent work" between existing phases
- User wants to "remove a phase" or "delete phase N"
- User asks to "plan gaps" or "fill coverage gaps"
- User asks about decimal phase numbering (e.g., 2.1, 3.1)

## Workflow Overview

```
1. Determine operation from natural language
2. Load roadmap and state context
3. Execute operation (add, insert, remove, plan-gaps)
4. Spawn kata-roadmapper for complex operations
5. Update STATE.md
6. Present results with next steps
```

## Operation Detection

Parse user request to identify operation:

| User says                                       | Operation | Description                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| "add phase", "add X to roadmap"                 | ADD       | Append to end of milestone |
| "insert phase", "urgent work", "between phases" | INSERT    | Decimal insertion          |
| "remove phase", "delete phase"                  | REMOVE    | Remove future phase        |
| "plan gaps", "fill gaps", "coverage gaps"       | PLAN-GAPS | Create gap closure phases  |

## ADD Phase Operation

Add a new integer phase to the end of the current milestone.

### Workflow

1. **Parse description** from user request
2. **Load roadmap** from `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
3. **Find current milestone** section
4. **Calculate next phase number:**
   - Find highest integer phase (ignore decimals)
   - Add 1 for next phase
   - Format as two-digit: `printf "%02d" $next`
5. **Generate slug** from description (kebab-case)
6. **Create phase directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ".planning/phases/${PHASE_NUM}-${SLUG}"
   ```
7. **Update ROADMAP.md** with new phase entry
8. **Update STATE.md** with roadmap evolution note

### Phase Entry Template

```markdown
### Phase {N}: {Description}

**Goal:** [To be planned]
**Depends on:** Phase {N-1}
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /kata:plan-phase {N} to break down)

**Details:**
[To be added during planning]
```

### Completion Output

Output this markdown directly (not as a code block):

Phase {N} added to current milestone:
- Description: {description}
- Directory: .planning/phases/{phase-num}-{slug}/
- Status: Not planned yet

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## ▶ Next Action

**Phase {N}: {description}**

`/kata:phase-plan {N}`

<sub>/clear first → fresh context window</sub>

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## INSERT Phase Operation (Urgent)

Insert a decimal phase for urgent work between existing integer phases.

### When to Use

- Urgent work discovered mid-milestone
- Must complete BEFORE next integer phase
- Can't wait until end of milestone

### Workflow

1. **Parse target phase** (insert AFTER which phase)
2. **Parse description** from user request
3. **Verify target phase exists** in ROADMAP.md
4. **Find existing decimals** after target (e.g., 2.1, 2.2)
5. **Calculate next decimal:**
   - No existing decimals → `.1`
   - Has 2.1 → `.2`
   - Has 2.1, 2.2 → `.3`
6. **Generate slug** from description
7. **Create phase directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ".planning/phases/${DECIMAL_PHASE}-${SLUG}"
   # Example: .planning/phases/02.1-fix-critical-bug/
   ```
8. **Update ROADMAP.md** with `(INSERTED)` marker
9. **Update STATE.md** with evolution note

### Decimal Numbering Reference

See `./references/decimal-numbering.md` for detailed conventions.

Key rules:
- Format: `{two-digit-integer}.{decimal}` (e.g., `02.1`, not `2.1`)
- Execute in order: 2 → 2.1 → 2.2 → 3
- Mark with `(INSERTED)` in roadmap
- Directory naming matches: `02.1-fix-name/`

### Phase Entry Template (Inserted)

```markdown
### Phase {N.M}: {Description} (INSERTED)

**Goal:** [Urgent work - to be planned]
**Depends on:** Phase {N}
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /kata:plan-phase {N.M} to break down)

**Details:**
[To be added during planning]
```

## REMOVE Phase Operation

Remove an unstarted future phase and renumber subsequent phases.

### Prerequisites

- Phase must be FUTURE (greater than current)
- Phase must be UNSTARTED (no SUMMARY.md files)
- User must confirm removal

### Workflow

1. **Parse target phase** from user request
2. **Load STATE.md** to find current phase
3. **Validate phase:**
   - Must exist in ROADMAP.md
   - Must be > current phase
   - No SUMMARY.md files in phase directory
4. **Gather info:**
   - Phase name from roadmap
   - Phase directory
   - Subsequent phases needing renumber
5. **Confirm with user:**
   ```
   Removing Phase {N}: {Name}

   This will:
   - Delete: .planning/phases/{N}-{slug}/
   - Renumber: Phases {N+1}-{M} → {N}-{M-1}

   Proceed? (y/n)
   ```
6. **Execute removal:**
   - Delete phase directory (if exists)
   - Renumber subsequent directories (descending order)
   - Rename files inside directories
   - Update ROADMAP.md (remove section, renumber)
   - Update STATE.md (phase count, progress)
   - Update internal references
7. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .planning/
   git commit -m "chore: remove phase {N} ({original-name})"
   ```

### Renumbering Reference

See `./references/phase-operations.md` for detailed renumbering rules.

Key rules:
- Process in descending order (avoid conflicts)
- Rename directories: `18-dashboard` → `17-dashboard`
- Rename files: `18-01-PLAN.md` → `17-01-PLAN.md`
- Update dependencies: `Depends on: Phase 18` → `Phase 17`
- Handle decimals under removed integer

## PLAN-GAPS Operation

Create phases to close gaps identified by milestone audit.

### Prerequisites

Requires MILESTONE-AUDIT.md file from `/kata:audit-milestone`

### Workflow

1. **Load audit results:**
   ```bash
   ls -t .planning/v*-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md | head -1
   ```
2. **Parse gaps:**
   - `gaps.requirements` — unsatisfied requirements
   - `gaps.integration` — missing cross-phase connections
   - `gaps.flows` — broken E2E flows
3. **Prioritize gaps:**
   | Priority | Action                         |
   | -------- | ------------------------------ |
   | `must`   | Create phase, blocks milestone |
   | `should` | Create phase, recommended      |
   | `nice`   | Ask user: include or defer?    |
4. **Group into phases:**
   - Same affected phase → combine
   - Same subsystem → combine
   - Dependency order (fix stubs before wiring)
   - Keep phases focused: 2-4 tasks each
5. **Calculate phase numbers** (continue from highest)
6. **Present gap closure plan:**
   ```markdown
   ## Gap Closure Plan

   **Gaps to close:** {N} requirements, {M} integration, {K} flows

   ### Proposed Phases

   **Phase {N}: {Name}**
   Closes:
   - {REQ-ID}: {description}
   - Integration: {from} → {to}

   Create these {X} phases? (yes / adjust / defer all optional)
   ```
7. **On confirmation:**
   - Update ROADMAP.md with new phases
   - Create phase directories
   - Commit roadmap update

### Gap-to-Phase Reference

See `./references/gap-planning.md` for mapping rules.

## Sub-Agent Spawning

For complex operations, spawn kata-roadmapper:

```
Task(
  prompt=roadmap_operation_prompt,
  subagent_type="kata-roadmapper",
  description="Execute {operation} for Phase {phase}"
)
```

### When to Spawn

| Operation    | Spawn Agent? | Reason                          |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| ADD (simple) | No           | Orchestrator handles directly   |
| INSERT       | Yes          | Complex ROADMAP.md updates      |
| REMOVE       | Yes          | Renumbering complexity          |
| PLAN-GAPS    | Yes          | Gap analysis and phase creation |

## Key References

For detailed guidance on specific operations:

- **Phase operations:** See `./references/phase-operations.md` for add, insert, remove workflows
- **Decimal numbering:** See `./references/decimal-numbering.md` for urgent insertion conventions
- **Gap planning:** See `./references/gap-planning.md` for audit-to-phase mapping

## Quality Standards

All roadmap operations must:

- [ ] Preserve roadmap formatting and structure
- [ ] Update STATE.md with evolution notes
- [ ] Maintain phase number continuity (no gaps)
- [ ] Use correct directory naming (`{NN}-{slug}` or `{NN.M}-{slug}`)
- [ ] Not modify completed phases
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't renumber completed phases** - Only future phases can be modified
- **Don't use decimal for planned work** - Decimals are for urgent insertions only
- **Don't create gaps** - Always renumber subsequent phases after removal
- **Don't skip confirmation** - Remove operation requires user confirmation
- **Don't commit without message** - Git history serves as audit trail
