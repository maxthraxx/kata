description: Use this skill when surfacing Claude's assumptions about a phase approach before planning, checking what Claude thinks, or validating understanding before planning. Triggers include "list assumptions", "what are you thinking", "show assumptions", "phase assumptions", and "what's the plan".

<kata_path>
**IMPORTANT:** Before reading any Kata file (templates, references, workflows), resolve the base path:

```bash
KATA_BASE=$(if [ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then echo "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/kata"; elif [ -d ~/.claude/kata ]; then echo ~/.claude/kata; else echo ./.claude/kata; fi) && echo $KATA_BASE
```

Use the output as `$KATA_BASE` for all file paths below. For example:
- `$KATA_BASE/templates/summary.md` instead of `~/.claude/kata/templates/summary.md`
</kata_path>

<objective>
Analyze a phase and present Claude's assumptions about technical approach, implementation order, scope boundaries, risk areas, and dependencies.

Purpose: Help users see what Claude thinks BEFORE planning begins - enabling course correction early when assumptions are wrong.
Output: Conversational output only (no file creation) - ends with "What do you think?" prompt
</objective>

<execution_context>
@$KATA_BASE/workflows/phase-assumptions.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

**Load project state first:**
@.planning/STATE.md

**Load roadmap:**
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
</context>

<process>
1. Validate phase number argument (error if missing or invalid)
2. Check if phase exists in roadmap
3. Follow phase-assumptions.md workflow:
   - Analyze roadmap description
   - Surface assumptions about: technical approach, implementation order, scope, risks, dependencies
   - Present assumptions clearly
   - Prompt "What do you think?"
4. Gather feedback and offer next steps
</process>

<success_criteria>

- Phase validated against roadmap
- Assumptions surfaced across five areas
- User prompted for feedback
- User knows next steps (discuss context, plan phase, or correct assumptions)
  </success_criteria>
