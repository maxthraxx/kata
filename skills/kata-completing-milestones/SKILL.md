<objective>
Mark milestone {{version}} complete, archive to milestones/, and update ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md.

Purpose: Create historical record of shipped version, archive milestone artifacts (roadmap + requirements), and prepare for next milestone.
Output: Milestone archived (roadmap + requirements), PROJECT.md evolved, git tagged.
</objective>

<execution_context>
**Load these files NOW (before proceeding):**

- @./references/milestone-complete.md (main workflow)
- @./references/milestone-archive-template.md (archive template)
  </execution_context>

<context>
**Project files:**
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/STATE.md`
- `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**User input:**

- Version: {{version}} (e.g., "1.0", "1.1", "2.0")
  </context>

<process>

**Follow milestone-complete.md workflow:**

0. **Pre-flight: Release artifacts**

   Before archiving, ensure release artifacts are ready:

   ```markdown
   ## Pre-flight: Release Artifacts

   ☐ CHANGELOG.md updated with v{{version}} entry
   ☐ package.json version set to {{version}}

   These should be committed BEFORE running this command.
   ```

   If either is missing, prompt:
   ```
   ⚠ Release artifacts not ready. Please update:
   - CHANGELOG.md — add v{{version}} entry
   - package.json — set version to {{version}}

   Then re-run /kata:milestone-complete
   ```

   Use AskUserQuestion:
   - header: "Release artifacts"
   - question: "Have you updated CHANGELOG.md and package.json for v{{version}}?"
   - options:
     - "Yes, continue" — Proceed with completion
     - "No, let me update them" — Exit to update

   If "No", exit command.

1. **Check for audit:**

   - Look for `.planning/v{{version}}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
   - If missing or stale: recommend `/kata:milestone-audit` first
   - If audit status is `gaps_found`: recommend `/kata:milestone-plan-gaps` first
   - If audit status is `passed`: proceed to step 1

   ```markdown
   ## Pre-flight Check

   {If no v{{version}}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md:}
   ⚠ No milestone audit found. Run `/kata:milestone-audit` first to verify
   requirements coverage, cross-phase integration, and E2E flows.

   {If audit has gaps:}
   ⚠ Milestone audit found gaps. Run `/kata:milestone-plan-gaps` to create
   phases that close the gaps, or proceed anyway to accept as tech debt.

   {If audit passed:}
   ✓ Milestone audit passed. Proceeding with completion.
   ```

1. **Verify readiness:**

   - Check all phases in milestone have completed plans (SUMMARY.md exists)
   - Present milestone scope and stats
   - Wait for confirmation

2. **Gather stats:**

   - Count phases, plans, tasks
   - Calculate git range, file changes, LOC
   - Extract timeline from git log
   - Present summary, confirm

3. **Extract accomplishments:**

   - Read all phase SUMMARY.md files in milestone range
   - Extract 4-6 key accomplishments
   - Present for approval

4. **Archive milestone:**

   - Create `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-ROADMAP.md`
   - Extract full phase details from ROADMAP.md
   - Fill milestone-archive.md template
   - Update ROADMAP.md to one-line summary with link

5. **Archive requirements:**

   - Create `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-REQUIREMENTS.md`
   - Mark all v1 requirements as complete (checkboxes checked)
   - Note requirement outcomes (validated, adjusted, dropped)
   - Delete `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (fresh one created for next milestone)

6. **Update PROJECT.md:**

   - Add "Current State" section with shipped version
   - Add "Next Milestone Goals" section
   - Archive previous content in `<details>` (if v1.1+)

7. **Commit and tag:**

   - Stage: MILESTONES.md, PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, archive files
   - Commit: `chore: complete v{{version}} milestone`

   **Check PR workflow mode:**

   ```bash
   PR_WORKFLOW=$(cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"pr_workflow"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[^,}]*' | grep -o 'true\|false' || echo "false")
   ```

   **If `PR_WORKFLOW=true`:**

   Skip git tag creation. Offer to create PR:

   Use AskUserQuestion:
   - header: "Create PR"
   - question: "Would you like me to create a PR for this milestone?"
   - options:
     - "Yes, create PR" — Create PR to merge to main
     - "No, I'll do it manually" — Show instructions only

   **If "Yes, create PR":**

   ```bash
   # Get current branch
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

   # Push branch if not already pushed
   git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true

   # Create PR
   gh pr create \
     --title "v{{version}}: [Milestone Name]" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary

   Completes milestone v{{version}}.

   **Key accomplishments:**
   - [accomplishment 1]
   - [accomplishment 2]
   - [accomplishment 3]

   ## After Merge

   Create GitHub Release with tag `v{{version}}` to trigger npm publish (if configured).
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   Display PR URL and next steps:
   ```
   ✓ PR created: [PR URL]

   After merge:
   → Create GitHub Release with tag v{{version}}
   → GitHub Actions will publish to npm (if configured)
   ```

   **If "No, I'll do it manually":**

   Display:
   ```
   ⚡ PR workflow mode — tag will be created via GitHub Release after merge

   Next steps:
   1. Create PR to merge this branch to main
   2. After merge, create GitHub Release with tag v{{version}}
   3. GitHub Actions will publish to npm (if configured)
   ```

   **If `PR_WORKFLOW=false` (default):**

   Create tag locally:
   - Tag: `git tag -a v{{version}} -m "[milestone summary]"`
   - Ask about pushing tag

8. **Offer next steps:**
   - `/kata:milestone-new` — start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)

</process>

<success_criteria>

- Milestone archived to `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-ROADMAP.md`
- Requirements archived to `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` deleted (fresh for next milestone)
- ROADMAP.md collapsed to one-line entry
- PROJECT.md updated with current state
- Git tag v{{version}} created (if pr_workflow=false) OR PR created/instructions given (if pr_workflow=true)
- Commit successful
- User knows next steps (including need for fresh requirements)
  </success_criteria>

<critical_rules>

- **Load workflow first:** Read milestone-complete.md before executing
- **Verify completion:** All phases must have SUMMARY.md files
- **User confirmation:** Wait for approval at verification gates
- **Archive before deleting:** Always create archive files before updating/deleting originals
- **One-line summary:** Collapsed milestone in ROADMAP.md should be single line with link
- **Context efficiency:** Archive keeps ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md constant size per milestone
- **Fresh requirements:** Next milestone starts with `/kata:milestone-new` which includes requirements definition
  </critical_rules>
