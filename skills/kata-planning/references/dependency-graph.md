# Dependency Graph Reference

Building dependency graphs for parallel execution and wave assignment.

## Building the Dependency Graph

**For each task identified, record:**

- `needs`: What must exist before this task runs (files, types, prior task outputs)
- `creates`: What this task produces (files, types, exports)
- `has_checkpoint`: Does this task require user interaction?

## Dependency Graph Construction

```
Example with 6 tasks:

Task A (User model): needs nothing, creates src/models/user.ts
Task B (Product model): needs nothing, creates src/models/product.ts
Task C (User API): needs Task A, creates src/api/users.ts
Task D (Product API): needs Task B, creates src/api/products.ts
Task E (Dashboard): needs Task C + D, creates src/components/Dashboard.tsx
Task F (Verify UI): checkpoint:human-verify, needs Task E

Graph:
  A --> C --\
              --> E --> F
  B --> D --/

Wave analysis:
  Wave 1: A, B (independent roots)
  Wave 2: C, D (depend only on Wave 1)
  Wave 3: E (depends on Wave 2)
  Wave 4: F (checkpoint, depends on Wave 3)
```

## Wave Assignment Algorithm

```
waves = {}  # plan_id -> wave_number

for each plan in plan_order:
  if plan.depends_on is empty:
    plan.wave = 1
  else:
    plan.wave = max(waves[dep] for dep in plan.depends_on) + 1

  waves[plan.id] = plan.wave
```

**Wave numbers are pre-computed during planning.** Execute-phase reads `wave` directly from frontmatter and groups plans by wave number.

## Vertical Slices vs Horizontal Layers

### Vertical Slices (PREFER)

```
Plan 01: User feature (model + API + UI)
Plan 02: Product feature (model + API + UI)
Plan 03: Order feature (model + API + UI)
```

Result: All three can run in parallel (Wave 1)

### Horizontal Layers (AVOID)

```
Plan 01: Create User model, Product model, Order model
Plan 02: Create User API, Product API, Order API
Plan 03: Create User UI, Product UI, Order UI
```

Result: Fully sequential (02 needs 01, 03 needs 02)

### When Vertical Slices Work

- Features are independent (no shared types/data)
- Each slice is self-contained
- No cross-feature dependencies

### When Horizontal Layers Are Necessary

- Shared foundation required (auth before protected features)
- Genuine type dependencies (Order needs User type)
- Infrastructure setup (database before all features)

## File Ownership for Parallel Execution

Exclusive file ownership prevents conflicts:

```yaml
# Plan 01 frontmatter
files_modified: [src/models/user.ts, src/api/users.ts]

# Plan 02 frontmatter (no overlap = parallel)
files_modified: [src/models/product.ts, src/api/products.ts]
```

**Rule:** No overlap -> can run parallel.

If a file appears in multiple plans, the later plan depends on the earlier (by plan number).

## Context Budget Rules

**Plans should complete within ~50% of context usage.**

Why 50% not 80%?
- No context anxiety possible
- Quality maintained start to finish
- Room for unexpected complexity
- If you target 80%, you've already spent 40% in degradation mode

**Each plan: 2-3 tasks maximum. Stay under 50% context.**

| Task Complexity | Tasks/Plan | Context/Task | Total |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Simple (CRUD, config) | 3 | ~10-15% | ~30-45% |
| Complex (auth, payments) | 2 | ~20-30% | ~40-50% |
| Very complex (migrations, refactors) | 1-2 | ~30-40% | ~30-50% |

## Split Signals

**ALWAYS split if:**
- More than 3 tasks (even if tasks seem small)
- Multiple subsystems (DB + API + UI = separate plans)
- Any task with >5 file modifications
- Checkpoint + implementation work in same plan
- Discovery + implementation in same plan

**CONSIDER splitting:**
- Estimated >5 files modified total
- Complex domains (auth, payments, data modeling)
- Any uncertainty about approach
- Natural semantic boundaries (Setup -> Core -> Features)

## Depth Calibration

Depth controls compression tolerance, not artificial inflation.

| Depth | Typical Plans/Phase | Tasks/Plan |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Quick | 1-3 | 2-3 |
| Standard | 3-5 | 2-3 |
| Comprehensive | 5-10 | 2-3 |

**Key principle:** Derive plans from actual work. Depth determines how aggressively you combine things, not a target to hit.

- Comprehensive auth phase = 8 plans (because auth genuinely has 8 concerns)
- Comprehensive "add config file" phase = 1 plan (because that's all it is)

Don't pad small work to hit a number. Don't compress complex work to look efficient.

## Estimating Context Per Task

| Files Modified | Context Impact |
|----------------|----------------|
| 0-3 files | ~10-15% (small) |
| 4-6 files | ~20-30% (medium) |
| 7+ files | ~40%+ (large - split) |

| Complexity | Context/Task |
|------------|--------------|
| Simple CRUD | ~15% |
| Business logic | ~25% |
| Complex algorithms | ~40% |
| Domain modeling | ~35% |
